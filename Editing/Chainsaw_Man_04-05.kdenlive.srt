1
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:53,031
If you want to save this cat, \Nthen bring me a human.

2
00:00:58,062 --> 00:01:00,087
One life is worth as little as any other.

3
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:03,012
And this is only a cat.

4
00:01:03,088 --> 00:01:07,037
So why do I run? \NWhy do I search for a human?

5
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:12,088
Is it to save Meowy?

6
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:19,078
Such a foolish reason.

7
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:26,007
I love blood.

8
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,044
The taste, the smell, \Nthe sense of mortality...

9
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:35,097
And then... there is something \NI only recently realized:

10
00:01:37,032 --> 00:01:39,028
The blood is warm...

11
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:42,027
And feels pleasant.

12
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,069
Why did you save me?

13
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:09,095
I attempted to kill you.

14
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,049
Such a foolish reason.

15
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:36,005
Forgive my deceit.

16
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:38,067
Since Meowy is safe...

17
00:02:39,054 --> 00:02:41,046
You may fondle my chest.

18
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:59,086
Hell {\i1}yeah{\i0}!

19
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:03,062
Holy shit! Ow!

20
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:06,025
That hurts!

21
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,081
Can you move?

22
00:05:03,043 --> 00:05:05,028
Not even a finger.

23
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:08,003
Take Meowy and flee, please.

24
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:20,034
Damn it, not enough chainsaw...

25
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:24,001
I must be low on blood.

26
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,010
And after I finally found him...

27
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:34,039
It's you, right? The one who killed Batty.

28
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:37,028
He was my man, y'know?!

29
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:43,054
Oh... but you're actually \Npretty cute yourself.

30
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:47,078
You're my type, so I'll let you go!

31
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,028
What about them?

32
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,075
They die.

33
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:03,009
Then you can die, too.

34
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:40,048
He can fight so fiercely...

35
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:43,084
To merely fondle a chest?

36
00:06:59,058 --> 00:07:01,031
Is this a joke?

37
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:05,032
How'd a little pupper \Nlike you kill my Batty?

38
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:13,009
Y'know, he and I shared a dream: \Nkilling and eating all of humanity.

39
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:17,008
A pipe dream, but a noble one, \Nand a romantic one.

40
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:20,047
And now this little \Nyipping dog has ruined it.

41
00:07:21,015 --> 00:07:23,098
You're cute enough that I regret it...

42
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:26,034
But you still need to die.

43
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,059
I'm not dying before I cop a feel.

44
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:32,039
That is ridiculous!

45
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,006
To think he was killed by someone \Nwith such a trashy dream.

46
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:38,085
Alas, poor Batty...

47
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,027
Such a foolish reason.

48
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:46,019
Everyone is serious about this except you.

49
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:13,038
Everybody wants to trash-talk my plans...

50
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:14,089
It's revenge this,

51
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:16,064
protect my family that,

52
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:18,014
and save a cat, too!

53
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:20,014
Blah, blah, blah!

54
00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:23,014
I guess your fancy dreams \Nmake you guys hot shit, huh?!

55
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:26,010
How about we have us a dream battle, then?! \NHow about that?!

56
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,002
If I murderize you,

57
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:32,065
that means your dream's \Nweaker than fondling a tit!

58
00:08:32,065 --> 00:08:34,058
Even your howls are cute!

59
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:36,086
But y'know what they say about \Nlittle dogs barking! Yap, yap, yap!

60
00:08:36,086 --> 00:08:40,029
Okay! I'll gobble you up, then!

61
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:42,041
Go ahead...

62
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:46,090
If you can beat me in the dream battle!

63
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:23,054
Demoniacal...

64
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:05,012
Time to {\i1}eat{\i0}...

65
00:10:10,097 --> 00:10:11,088
Kon.

66
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:20,039
Huh... Huh?

67
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,089
Looks like she's the Leech Devil. \NMay I swallow?

68
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,002
Do it.

69
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,083
The Leech Devil's extermination is confirmed.

70
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:48,006
I want the rookies handling search \Nand rescue, plus assisting with the evac.

71
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:49,016
Yes, sir!

72
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:52,068
Himeno, you've got seniority, \Nso keep watch for more devils.

73
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,060
On it.

74
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:59,005
Dream battle... Gonna... My dream battle...

75
00:10:59,048 --> 00:11:01,099
You and the Blood Fiend \Nneed to be debriefed.

76
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,088
And Meowy?

77
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:13,061
Have the cat sent to a veterinarian \Nfor a thorough checkup.

78
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:30,078
I found your arm.

79
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:34,008
A blood infusion was all \Nit needed to reattach.

80
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:36,098
You really are like a devil.

81
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:41,034
{\i1}You{\i0} seemed pretty friendly \Nwith that devil back there.

82
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:43,023
I saw.

83
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,022
You really don't know a thing, huh?

84
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,082
Devil Hunters form contracts with \Ndevils in order to fight against them.

85
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:55,056
I've got a contract with the Fox Devil.

86
00:11:55,098 --> 00:12:00,060
In exchange for power, \NI offer up a bit of my body as food.

87
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:03,028
It was some skin this time.

88
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:06,011
Sounds painful.

89
00:12:07,021 --> 00:12:09,077
Devils yearn for the deaths of humans.

90
00:12:10,038 --> 00:12:12,054
The same goes for Fiends.

91
00:12:14,002 --> 00:12:16,042
Power seems cool, though.

92
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:23,089
The surveillance cameras caught \Nyou two headed to your patrol area.

93
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:24,093
{\an7\pos(120,85)\bord0\c&HC0CCC4&\fs35}Paused

94
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:29,006
And the house that we believe \Nwas housing the Bat Devil

95
00:12:29,006 --> 00:12:31,022
contained a lot of your spilt blood.

96
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:35,050
The Blood Fiend tried to kill you, didn't she?

97
00:12:36,034 --> 00:12:41,011
I don't know why, but you're trying \Nto protect a devil. Again.

98
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,086
I dunno... {\i1}is{\i0} that how it happened?

99
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:52,018
My daughter would like \Nto meet the chainsaw guy.

100
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:53,051
Thank you.

101
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:58,006
The devil threatened to eat \Nme back at the office,

102
00:12:58,006 --> 00:13:00,060
but now that I think about it, he was \Nwearing a Public Safety uniform.

103
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,019
I'd like to thank him.

104
00:13:02,093 --> 00:13:05,024
"Don't give a shit about \Nsaving some dude," he says!

105
00:13:05,024 --> 00:13:07,036
And then the devil throws \Nmy car with me in it!

106
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,059
It was a devil with a chainsaw \Ncoming out of its head...

107
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:16,064
If I dig deeper into this, \Nand report it to the higher-ups,

108
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:20,014
it'd mean the Blood Fiend gets disposed of\N along with you, since you covered for her.

109
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,090
But there were no fatalities.

110
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:27,041
So, if you're willing to accept one condition, \NI'll let what happened slide.

111
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,059
You need to do what I tell you to.

112
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,017
You're a dumbass and a brat \Nwith no clue about right and wrong.

113
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:42,058
I've been doing this longer, so I'm pretty\N sure I have some grasp of social ethics.

114
00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:47,043
All you need to do to protect \Nthis lifestyle is listen to me.

115
00:13:50,026 --> 00:13:52,093
How about it? If you follow, \NI want an answer.

116
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:58,044
Sure. I'll keep it in mind.

117
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:01,060
You can relax.

118
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:05,041
I might not be after some \Nbig-deal goal like you guys,

119
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,093
and I might dream small.

120
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,070
But I'm as serious about this as you are.

121
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:15,051
You can count on me.

122
00:14:19,065 --> 00:14:22,021
Try and learn some manners in the meantime.

123
00:14:22,053 --> 00:14:25,068
Yeah, I'll think about it.

124
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,053
You see? Am I not innocent?

125
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,048
Now, would you kindly take these off?

126
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:43,012
Is this a good idea?

127
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:46,040
When this cutie-Fiend kills somebody,

128
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,024
it's gonna be your responsibility, \Nfor letting her live.

129
00:14:49,024 --> 00:14:51,084
We're Devil Hunters.

130
00:14:51,084 --> 00:14:53,063
Whether they're devils or Fiends,

131
00:14:53,063 --> 00:14:55,094
if they're handy, \Nwe should put them to work.

132
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,012
But they're still the enemy. \NWe're just making use of them.

133
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,037
We're not making friends.

134
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,074
Come in.

135
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:38,051
Excuse me.

136
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:51,019
And he claims they "were outside \Nthe patrol zone before they knew it,"

137
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:55,071
and that they discovered a house that\N"looked like it had a super-nasty devil in it,"

138
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:58,024
which is where they encountered \Nthe Bat Devil.

139
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:02,027
Denji used his chainsaws to\N exterminate the Bat Devil,

140
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:05,018
and then came under attack \Nby the Leech Devil...

141
00:16:05,018 --> 00:16:07,061
Which Division 4 exterminated.

142
00:16:08,003 --> 00:16:12,074
There were no traces of Gun flesh \Nin either the Bat or Leech Devil's heads.

143
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,058
That concludes my report.

144
00:16:17,056 --> 00:16:18,090
Well done.

145
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:26,088
But Denji and Power managed to get awfully \Nfar without anyone noticing, didn't they?

146
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,013
I'd chalk that up to them \Nbeing unbelievably stupid.

147
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:34,050
Leaving the approved area \Nis against regulations.

148
00:16:34,088 --> 00:16:37,034
Considering there were no fatalities,

149
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:42,006
and that we were able to get rid of \Ntwo devils, I think it's worth overlooking.

150
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,027
Understood.

151
00:16:49,077 --> 00:16:51,088
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.

152
00:16:53,018 --> 00:16:56,057
You seem a little more \Nflexible now, Hayakawa.

153
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:01,064
Is that Denji's influence, I wonder?

154
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,035
I doubt it.

155
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:07,037
I haven't changed at all.

156
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,026
How's he up so early?

157
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:08,098
What's for lunch?

158
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,062
Curry.

159
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,098
Sweet!

160
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:18,001
The hell's this? A devil?

161
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:27,092
What a pitiful home this is!

162
00:19:31,027 --> 00:19:35,088
I'd like you to put Power up \Nin one of your rooms, Hayakawa.

163
00:19:36,027 --> 00:19:41,028
I think you'll make a good leash \Nfor the two of them.

164
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:43,094
Stop right there, Meowy!

165
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:47,021
It seems you've got quite a feast!

166
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:49,041
Damn it, who said you could come in?!

167
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,052
'Tis mine now!

168
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:52,067
Gimme my super toast back!

169
00:19:53,022 --> 00:19:55,042
Oh... okay.

170
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:58,075
It'd be a little odd to have her \Nstaying at the office indefinitely.

171
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,042
Okay.

172
00:20:04,057 --> 00:20:09,037
You don't need to worry. \NPower said she would behave.

173
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,031
It'll be fine.

174
00:20:13,069 --> 00:20:15,029
Vegetables are revolting!

175
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:16,004
Away!

176
00:20:16,043 --> 00:20:17,039
Carrot!

177
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,097
Don't fling your vegetables!

178
00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:21,008
Damn it...

179
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:25,036
Show some respect to the farmers \Nwho grew the veggies, devil!

180
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:28,020
The toilet?

181
00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:30,083
I prefer to only occasionally \Nflush my feces.

182
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,005
Flush it!

183
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:33,046
It stinks.

184
00:20:33,076 --> 00:20:35,067
I prefer to only occasionally bathe.

185
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,087
Get in there!

186
00:20:36,087 --> 00:20:38,034
You reek!

187
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:40,050
You two are absurd.

188
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,097
How delicate these humans be.

189
00:20:42,097 --> 00:20:44,034
Aren't they, Meowy?

190
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:57,036
Can't believe she just shows up \Nand starts raising hell.

191
00:20:57,036 --> 00:21:00,011
Do devils not flush the toilet?

192
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:02,022
Didn't eat her veggies either.

193
00:21:02,022 --> 00:21:03,061
You there...

194
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:09,037
Hey, Shit Devil! Your turds are stuck \Nto the damn toilet and won't come off!

195
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:18,009
We had a deal, did we not?

196
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:20,029
You may fondle my chest.

197
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:21,063
So, fondle!

198
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:40,069
Come now, what's the matter? \NAren't you pleased?

199
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:42,023
Commence your fondling.

200
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:49,049
I have stipulations, however.

201
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:54,012
You have earned three squeezes of my breast.

202
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:56,007
Three?

203
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:59,032
One for your rescue of Meowy.

204
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:02,010
A second for slaying the Bat Devil.

205
00:22:02,048 --> 00:22:06,066
And a third for protecting me from topknot!

206
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,097
I had no intention of actually letting you,

207
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,047
but your efforts have earned \Nyou these three squeezes.

208
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:15,044
Squeeze them gratefully.

209
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:24,019
She's an angel!

210
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:27,099

00:24:18,116 --> 00:24:19,193

216
00:24:33,143 --> 00:24:34,156
What the...?

217
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:36,159
Breast pads.

218
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,156
A wondrous invention that \Nmakes your bosom look bigger.

219
00:24:44,118 --> 00:24:46,119
Now! Two squeezes remain.

220
00:24:56,116 --> 00:24:58,123
And now! The final fondling!

221
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,146
There, done! All done!

222
00:25:04,146 --> 00:25:07,139
What did you think? Was it not fantastic?

223
00:25:08,193 --> 00:25:11,137
How lucky for you, to grasp \Nsuch splendorous things!

224
00:25:11,137 --> 00:25:13,147
And now we are even!

225
00:25:13,147 --> 00:25:18,109
With Meowy saved, I have no real reason \Nto hunt devils any longer,

226
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:19,173
There's lots of stuff I could say, but... Huh?

227
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:20,148
yet there's no escaping Makima!

228
00:25:20,148 --> 00:25:23,104
So I will aid you all with your duty!

229
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,181
I'm sure the pleasure is all yours!

230
00:25:27,135 --> 00:25:28,193
Meowy! Off to bed we go!

231
00:25:35,126 --> 00:25:36,152
That's it?

232
00:27:14,121 --> 00:27:16,157
This is good!

233
00:27:18,122 --> 00:27:20,129
Seconds would be splendid!

234
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:21,159
I'll eat yours, if you won't have it!

235
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:22,122
You little...!

236
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:25,123
Where shall we slaughter devils today?

237
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:27,193
Hey.

238
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,119
Hey!

239
00:27:31,123 --> 00:27:32,189
Hey!

240
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,124
Chop!

241
00:27:36,192 --> 00:27:39,174
This is the form apology \Nfor the damage to the buildings.

242
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:43,163
This is for verifying \Nthe disposal of the devils' bodies.

243
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:47,109
Then there's this, from the Ministry of Land, \NInfrastructure, Transport and Tourism.

244
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:49,125
You'll need to stamp it, here and here.

245
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:58,167
I hate making you do all this paperwork.

246
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:02,151
It's almost like killing \Nthe Bat Devil was a bad thing.

247
00:28:04,163 --> 00:28:08,102
Is something bothering you, Denji?

248
00:28:10,195 --> 00:28:12,102
Y'know, I...

249
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,151
There's something I was chasing after, \Nand I finally managed to get it.

250
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:20,102
But once I did, it wasn't...

251
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:23,178
as big of a deal as I thought.

252
00:28:24,131 --> 00:28:30,108
Now I'm wondering, if I go after \Nsomething else, and get my hands on it,

253
00:28:31,124 --> 00:28:36,102
am I just gonna think \NI was happier during the chase?

254
00:28:38,102 --> 00:28:41,170
That's, like... total bullshit, isn't it?

255
00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:47,106
What exactly are you talking about, Denji?

256
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:52,156
I touched boobs for the first time,\N but it wasn't that great.

257
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,170
Denji...

258
00:29:04,106 --> 00:29:05,170
I believe that, when it comes to sex,

259
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:11,187
the better you understand \Nthe other person, the better it feels.

260
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:19,108
But it's hard to understand \Nhow someone else feels.

261
00:29:20,174 --> 00:29:24,122
So, start with observing \Nthe hand, carefully.

262
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:29,135
How long are their fingers?

263
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:35,174
Are their palms cold?

264
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:37,183
Are they warm?

265
00:29:39,155 --> 00:29:41,110
What's the shape of their ears?

266
00:29:46,116 --> 00:29:48,149
Ever had your finger bitten?

267
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:49,175
B-Bit...?

268
00:29:49,175 --> 00:29:51,110
Remember this.

269
00:29:52,108 --> 00:29:54,191
So that even if you can't see,

270
00:29:55,188 --> 00:30:00,176
you'll be able to tell it's me, \Nfrom how hard I'm biting.

271
00:30:02,143 --> 00:30:03,169
Memorize it.

272
00:30:14,148 --> 00:30:16,152
I... got it.

273
00:30:47,156 --> 00:30:49,105
Denji...

274
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:53,106
I'd like to ask you to do something for me.

275
00:30:53,175 --> 00:30:54,194
Can I?

276
00:30:57,111 --> 00:30:58,119
Yeah.

277
00:31:03,158 --> 00:31:06,112
I want you to beat the Gun Devil.

278
00:31:07,104 --> 00:31:08,150
Gun Devil?

279
00:31:09,149 --> 00:31:15,155
It appeared in America 13 years ago, \Nbut nobody knows where it is now.

280
00:31:16,118 --> 00:31:21,134
It's a very strong devil \Nthat all hunters want to kill.

281
00:31:23,102 --> 00:31:27,125
But I happen to think that you can kill it.

282
00:31:27,197 --> 00:31:32,160
Because you're not like any \Nof the other Devil Hunters.

283
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,198
And if you're able to kill the Gun Devil,

284
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:41,181
I'll make any wish of yours come true.

285
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,148
You're saying if your Denji\N kills the Gun Devil,

286
00:31:47,148 --> 00:31:52,124
Miss Makima's gonna make \Nany wish of his come true?

287
00:31:54,197 --> 00:31:57,173
So... like, I mean...

288
00:31:58,145 --> 00:32:00,163
You're saying if your Denji\N kills the Gun Devil,

289
00:32:00,163 --> 00:32:04,151
Miss Makima's gonna make \N{\i1}any{\i0} wish of his come true?

290
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:12,147
{\i1}Anything{\i0}, like... even se—

291
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:14,177
I said anything, Denji.

292
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,152
Holy shit! Is that even allowed?!

293
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:23,158
It's only allowed because this devil \Nis so strong and bad, mind you.

294
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:26,147
People were trying to profit off of guns

295
00:32:26,147 --> 00:32:28,198
as a counter-measure against \Ndevils across the world,

296
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:32,104
which resulted in an increase \Nin crime and conflict.

297
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,121
The news focused on it \Nnon-stop for a while,

298
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:40,125
with people more afraid \Nof gun violence than ever.

299
00:32:41,137 --> 00:32:45,167
Then a major armed terrorist \Nattack happened in America.

300
00:32:46,134 --> 00:32:49,127
That was the day the Gun Devil appeared.

301
00:32:53,112 --> 00:32:58,189
"This is where I live," said the city mouse.

302
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,189

00:32:59,194 --> 00:33:03,141
And, oh what a big house it was!

304
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:05,127
The city mouse's family—

305
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:05,127
Dad!

306
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,186
Let's play catch outside.

307
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:12,121
Taiyo doesn't feel well. \NFind something you can play by yourself.

308
00:33:12,163 --> 00:33:14,141
He never does.

309
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:16,129
I don't remember him feeling good.

310
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:20,129
You're the older brother. \NBe good and play by yourself.

311
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:23,122
I...

312
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:26,180
I wanna play with him.

313
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,139
Quit following me.

314
00:33:52,121 --> 00:33:54,149
You're so annoying... I said cut it out!

315
00:33:58,151 --> 00:34:00,122
I'm gonna play by myself.

316
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:07,198
Gotcha!

317
00:34:10,185 --> 00:34:12,192
Stupid! I said cut it out!

318
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:22,193
It's cold...

319
00:34:29,123 --> 00:34:32,171
If you catch a cold, \NI'm gonna get in trouble.

320
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:38,138
Your hands won't get cold \Nif we play catch, right?

321
00:34:39,135 --> 00:34:41,106
Go grab a glove from the house.

322
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,144
Yes!

323
00:35:05,198 --> 00:35:10,168
In a little under five minutes, \N1.2 million people were killed.

324
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,101
The Gun Devil hasn't been seen since.

325
00:35:20,143 --> 00:35:25,136
Fear of devils across the board \Nincreased as a result,

326
00:35:25,185 --> 00:35:30,127
making them all stronger than ever before.

327
00:35:31,176 --> 00:35:37,149
Gun control got a lot more severe \Nin an attempt to weaken the Gun Devil...

328
00:35:37,149 --> 00:35:41,189
Along with increased censorship of the news.

329
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:45,165
I'm not sure I understand, but...

330
00:35:45,165 --> 00:35:48,165
Let's say this thing's so strong, \Nit's hard to understand.

331
00:35:49,117 --> 00:35:51,165
Do you think you can beat it, Denji?

332
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:54,140
Well... I'd say...

333
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,137
If I bust out all the stops,

334
00:35:58,112 --> 00:36:00,117
it'll be a {\i1}peace{\i0} of cake.

335
00:36:01,113 --> 00:36:02,178
In that case...

336
00:36:02,178 --> 00:36:05,137
First, we'll need to actually \Nfind the Gun Devil.

337
00:36:06,196 --> 00:36:09,146
How exactly are we gonna do that, anyway?

338
00:36:10,149 --> 00:36:13,158
These are pieces of the Gun Devil \Nthat we've collected.

339
00:36:13,158 --> 00:36:17,177
It's so fast, pieces of it \Nare torn off just from moving.

340
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,172
If a devil eats some of this,

341
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:25,124
no matter what their nature, \Nthey become more powerful.

342
00:36:25,124 --> 00:36:26,181
See how they stick together?

343
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:31,174
Because of how powerful the Gun Devil is,

344
00:36:31,174 --> 00:36:34,159
once the chunks of flesh \Nreach a certain size,

345
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,188
they start to be attracted \Nto the original body.

346
00:36:37,188 --> 00:36:41,145
So if we can make this piece bigger,

347
00:36:42,124 --> 00:36:44,161
it'll lead us to the Gun Devil.

348
00:36:45,145 --> 00:36:46,150
Got one.

349
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:52,150
So it really was snacking \Non a piece of the Gun.

350
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:56,179
Explains how such \Na wimpy devil got so strong.

351
00:36:57,197 --> 00:37:00,174
But did it find that piece, \Nor did someone serve it up?

352
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,139
Doesn't change what our job is.

353
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,177
We keep killing devils,

354
00:37:09,138 --> 00:37:12,179
and eventually, we'll find him.

355
00:37:16,156 --> 00:37:19,115
Public Safety's received a request \Nfor devil extermination.

356
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,116
A devil has been spotted inside of a hotel.

357
00:37:22,116 --> 00:37:24,184
No confirmation on the status \Nof the hotel's guests.

358
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:29,159
Several of the civilian devil hunters \Nwho initially went in have been found dead.

359
00:37:29,191 --> 00:37:34,118
It's believed the target has \Nconsumed a piece of the Gun Devil.

360
00:37:34,184 --> 00:37:39,128
We're sending six agents from Public Safety \NDevil Extermination Special Division 4.

361
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:46,118
It's hiding somewhere in this hotel.

362
00:37:46,118 --> 00:37:49,131
And this is no ordinary devil.

363
00:37:49,161 --> 00:37:52,101
It's eaten a piece of the Gun Devil's flesh.

364
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,119
Maybe it's the Gun Devil for real?

365
00:37:56,123 --> 00:38:00,182
The more flesh, the stronger the attraction. \NThe reaction's not big enough.

366
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:03,120
Huh, guess not.

367
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,195
How amusing... Give that thing to me!

368
00:38:08,115 --> 00:38:10,145
I thought I told you two \Nto work on your manners.

369
00:38:12,162 --> 00:38:16,184
Who the hell's gonna suck up \Nto you for no reason?

370
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:16,184
How foolish and conceited these humans be!

371
00:38:20,149 --> 00:38:22,102
Mr. Hayakawa.

372
00:38:22,102 --> 00:38:23,126
Sir.

373
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:24,148
Good.

374
00:38:24,148 --> 00:38:25,169
Sweet!

375
00:38:26,186 --> 00:38:27,164
Dude, he's so easy.

376
00:38:27,164 --> 00:38:28,176
Hayakawa!

377
00:38:29,128 --> 00:38:32,127
Considering we're about \Nto fight some devils...

378
00:38:32,127 --> 00:38:35,102
Can we really trust these two \Nto watch our backs?

379
00:38:35,149 --> 00:38:38,142
One's a Fiend, and the other is some punk...

380
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:40,171
I'm not sure about this.

381
00:38:42,104 --> 00:38:44,120
We can't let them watch our backs.

382
00:38:44,186 --> 00:38:48,143
On extermination missions, \Nthey'll be taking point.

383
00:38:48,143 --> 00:38:52,142
If they try to run \Nor switch sides, we kill them.

384
00:38:52,187 --> 00:38:55,104
You're treating us like livestock!

385
00:38:55,104 --> 00:38:57,167
You two don't get rights.

386
00:38:58,197 --> 00:39:01,104
He's super pissed.

387
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:02,157
Must be from this morning.

388
00:39:02,157 --> 00:39:05,105
Perhaps our prank went too far?

389
00:39:05,105 --> 00:39:08,137
You call that a prank?! I could kill you!

390
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,156
Yikes! What happened?

391
00:39:11,103 --> 00:39:14,177
Aki, you can't just be harsh \Nall the time, y'know?

392
00:39:14,177 --> 00:39:18,174
She's right! The bat almost killed me, \Nand now there's more work?!

393
00:39:18,174 --> 00:39:19,194
I want a reward!

394
00:39:21,173 --> 00:39:24,195
Got it! I'll take one for the team.

395
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,186
Whoever kills this devil will win...

396
00:39:27,186 --> 00:39:30,199
a kiss on the cheek from yours truly!

397
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,146
That's... You shouldn't do that!

398
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:38,171
A young woman who's not married \Nshouldn't be so... indecent!

399
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:43,110
But doesn't a reward help with motivation?

400
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,171
Right?

401
00:39:54,168 --> 00:39:56,142
I'm not gonna sweat the kisses.

402
00:39:56,142 --> 00:39:59,123
Don't worry about it. I'm plenty motivated.

403
00:39:59,123 --> 00:40:00,123
Oh?

404
00:40:00,123 --> 00:40:03,173
I got my sights set on someone \Nfor a first kiss already.

405
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:08,117
I'm gonna find all these meat chunks \Nor whatever for her.

406
00:40:08,117 --> 00:40:11,135
So, until the Gun Devil's dead, \Nno smooching for me.

407
00:40:13,184 --> 00:40:16,105
That's a hell of a thing \Nto say in front of Aki!

408
00:40:16,105 --> 00:40:18,187
Besides, I learned something real important.

409
00:40:19,164 --> 00:40:24,106
Sex stuff feels better when it's \Ntwo people who get each other.

410
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:28,138
I don't even know your name, \Nso I ain't after your lips!

411
00:40:33,108 --> 00:40:36,179
Then, if you kill the devil, Denji...

412
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,177
I'll give you a kiss... with tongue.

413
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,128
Hey, hold it!

414
00:40:50,101 --> 00:40:52,153
It's dangerous to run off solo! Stop!

415
00:40:52,153 --> 00:40:56,120
{\move(420,40,640,40)\t(904,1404,\blur1.5}th Floor

416
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:56,102
Damn, I love teasing boys!

417
00:40:56,179 --> 00:40:59,117
Oh man, what are we gonna do?

418
00:40:59,117 --> 00:41:00,179
I yearn for blood.

419
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:03,170
It's dangerous! You need to stop!

420
00:41:06,171 --> 00:41:10,168
Himeno's been nice enough to train me \Nfor the last six months!

421
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:13,184
If the alternative is letting \Nsome thug like you kiss her...

422
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:15,178
Then I'll take that kiss on the cheek!

423
00:41:15,178 --> 00:41:16,181
Move!

424
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:19,136
I don't want some dude \Nall over me! It's nasty!

425
00:41:19,136 --> 00:41:20,129
Say what?!

426
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:24,119
Die! I'm after a way \Nbigger goal than you, dude!

427
00:41:21,194 --> 00:41:24,119
I wish to join you!

428
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:27,147
Shut up! I don't wanna hear that \Nfrom someone newer than me!

429
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,109
What's your take on the rookies, Himeno?

430
00:41:27,147 --> 00:41:29,109
Man, shut up!

431
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:30,154
More of this! Yes!

432
00:41:31,142 --> 00:41:35,145
I'd say Arai's not super competent, \Nbut makes up for it in motivation.

433
00:41:35,145 --> 00:41:37,133
Get him, get him!

434
00:41:36,104 --> 00:41:39,138
Meanwhile, Kobeni's got the moves, \Nbut she's really timid.

435
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,192
You think any of the four rookies \Nhave a shot of surviving, Aki?

436
00:41:43,192 --> 00:41:45,190
It's a duel to the death!

437
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,175
You get the picture, now?

438
00:41:50,134 --> 00:41:53,153
regardless of how strong \NI thought they were.

439
00:41:51,158 --> 00:41:53,193
You are not kissing Himeno!

440
00:41:53,193 --> 00:41:55,150
Asshole... I'm gonna kill you!

441
00:41:54,169 --> 00:41:57,118
That's not really an answer.

442
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,118
Power... you're dead, too!

443
00:41:58,163 --> 00:42:00,168
You too, shorty.

444
00:42:00,168 --> 00:42:01,163
But why?!

445
00:42:17,169 --> 00:42:18,170
Himeno...

446
00:42:19,185 --> 00:42:21,198
This is your new partner.

447
00:42:22,192 --> 00:42:26,119
He's rude, but I trained him \Nto be of some use.

448
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,139
Try and get along.

449
00:42:32,197 --> 00:42:33,184
I'm Aki.

450
00:42:34,168 --> 00:42:35,172
Nice to meet you.

451
00:42:41,198 --> 00:42:43,142
Are you gonna be any help?

452
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:48,161
Well... I think so.

453
00:42:49,158 --> 00:42:52,176
You're gonna be my sixth partner.

454
00:42:52,176 --> 00:42:54,128
The others all died.

455
00:42:55,127 --> 00:42:57,175
They all died because they were useless.

456
00:43:01,135 --> 00:43:03,116
Don't die on me, Aki.

457
00:43:04,154 --> 00:43:08,186
Gotta say, I'm not seeing \Nany devils around here.

458
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,161
Does that meat chunk of yours even work?

459
00:43:16,181 --> 00:43:18,126
So tired...

460
00:43:18,126 --> 00:43:19,132
Aki...

461
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:22,101
Incoming.

462
00:43:46,198 --> 00:43:47,192
Got it.

463
00:43:49,117 --> 00:43:50,104
It floats?!

464
00:43:50,162 --> 00:43:52,138
The battle is joined!

465
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,158
Damnable devil! Did you see \Nhow it floated in fear of me?!

466
00:44:05,164 --> 00:44:07,172
No, no, that's my power.

467
00:44:07,172 --> 00:44:08,156
Say what?

468
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:12,122
I've got a contract with the Ghost Devil.

469
00:44:12,122 --> 00:44:17,105
I served up my right eye in exchange \Nfor being able to use a ghost's right hand.

470
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:21,191
My ghost hand's invisible \Nand strong. Pretty slick, right?

471
00:44:23,102 --> 00:44:26,124
How about it, Aki? \NHas he got any of the Gun's flesh?

472
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:29,158
No strong reaction. This isn't the one.

473
00:44:29,158 --> 00:44:33,103
I see... guess we better keep heading up.

474
00:44:34,181 --> 00:44:39,165
Is it wise to blather on about \Nyour powers in my presence?

475
00:44:39,165 --> 00:44:42,183
Are you people not meant to hold my reins?

476
00:44:42,183 --> 00:44:45,195
Knowing about our powers makes \Nfor better teamwork, right?

477
00:44:45,195 --> 00:44:49,126
Besides, I've got a few tricks \Nup my sleeve, so I'm not worried.

478
00:44:49,126 --> 00:44:51,121
Truly?

479
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:54,132
So what would you do if I said \NI was going to kill this one?

480
00:44:55,161 --> 00:44:57,146
Put the weapon away.

481
00:44:57,146 --> 00:45:00,149
If you misbehave, \NI can always choke you to death.

482
00:45:03,128 --> 00:45:04,199
Can't... touch it...

483
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:14,106
I'd prefer if we got along. It's easier!

484
00:45:16,173 --> 00:45:18,199
I will devour you in time!

485
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:21,126
You better not. I'm trying to get a kiss.

486
00:45:21,172 --> 00:45:25,169
Do you guys not get that the devil \Nis still around? Can't you pipe...

487
00:45:29,155 --> 00:45:30,177
Huh?

488
00:45:36,104 --> 00:45:38,148
She does look like \Nshe'd be unpleasant raw.

489
00:45:37,173 --> 00:45:38,148
What is it?

490
00:45:38,148 --> 00:45:40,180
That sounds pervy, dude.

491
00:45:39,134 --> 00:45:44,128
We were... on our way to \Nthe 9th floor from the 8th, right?

492
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,130
Perhaps boiling or frying...

493
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:45,128
Cook your own ass, stupid.

494
00:45:44,128 --> 00:45:45,128
{\pos(313,41)\fs10\fsp.7}th Floor

495
00:45:46,192 --> 00:45:48,152
But this is the 8th floor.

496
00:45:50,129 --> 00:45:52,117
You probably read it wrong.

497
00:45:52,117 --> 00:45:54,188
It's not that! Something's going on here!

498
00:45:54,188 --> 00:45:55,192
I'm gonna double check.

499
00:45:55,192 --> 00:45:58,145
I know! Grilled like a steak!

500
00:45:58,145 --> 00:45:59,142
Steak?!

501
00:45:59,142 --> 00:46:01,155
I wanna try steak!

502
00:46:04,188 --> 00:46:05,177
Huh?

503
00:46:08,163 --> 00:46:12,169
Arai... just now... you were \Ngoing downstairs, right?
