1
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:54,071
Better head to work.

2
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,012
It's about 60,000 a month \Nfor cutting down trees, right?

3
00:01:20,088 --> 00:01:25,025
Then there's the kidney I sold. \NThat was 1.2 million.

4
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:29,048
My right eye was 300,000.

5
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:32,037
Sold one of my nuts...

6
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:37,022
How much was that, again? \NI think... not even 100,000.

7
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:42,087
And I still owe...

8
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,087
About 38,040,000 yen.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,005
I heard you, Pochita.

10
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:54,085
Let's kill this thing already.

11
00:01:55,088 --> 00:02:00,072
A dead devil's usually good \Nfor about 300,000...

12
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:07,042
Devil hunting pays the best, easy.

13
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,097
Gotta be the Tomato Devil.

14
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,037
He'll revive from the seeds, \Nso you'll wanna burn those.

15
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,991
Nice work, Denji.

16
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:38,032
This carcass will bring in a fair \Nprice on the black market.

17
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,028
I'll pay you 400,000.

18
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,028
Hey, thanks!

19
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,059
After what you owe and \Nthe interest, that leaves 170,000.

20
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:47,050
So after the finder's fee, admin fee,

21
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:52,027
management costs, and so on...

22
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,076
Leaves me with 70,000.

23
00:02:55,008 --> 00:03:01,042
After the water bill, \Nand some other stuff I owe...

24
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,106
Funny how that works.

25
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,051
I've got 1,800 yen left.

26
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:13,073
No food at home, and this is gonna \Nhave to last us a month, so...

27
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,999
Pochita, looks like dinner's \Ngonna be a slice of bread.

28
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,995
Why hire a brat like that to hunt devils?

29
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,998
He's paying off what he owes us.

30
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,084
Well, technically, it was \Nhis deadbeat old man's debt.

31
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:40,013
And a kid with a pet devil \Ncan get the job done?

32
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,028
The thing about real devil hunters is...

33
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:47,091
They don't pass devil \Ncarcasses onto the yakuza.

34
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:52,025
Besides, the best thing about Denji \Nis he does what he's told.

35
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,032
Hey, dog!

36
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,077
I'll give you 100 yen to eat this cigarette.

37
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,001
For real?

38
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,085
Don't mind if I do.

39
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,036
We'll be in touch \Nwhen there's another devil.

40
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,100
Try and run, and you're pig slop.

41
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,075
That'll keep us for another three days.

42
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,061
The other day I heard...

43
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:47,000
That normally, people put jam \Non their bread, before eating it.

44
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:51,045
Normal's just a dream for us, though.

45
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,084
Doubt I'll pay off this debt before I die.

46
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,101
Probably gonna die without \Never having a girlfriend, too.

47
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:06,076
Not like I could invite a girl to this dump.

48
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,101
No money to go on dates, either.

49
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,981
If I could have one dream come true...

50
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,050
I wanna score with a girl before I die.

51
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:38,055
Bastard hung himself {\i1}without{\i0} \Npaying this month's installment first.

52
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,049
Boy, you've got until tomorrow \Nto put 700,000 together.

53
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,030
You can beg for it, whore yourself out...\N I don't care. Get it done.

54
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,055
Otherwise, we chop you up and sell the bits.

55
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,019
A ch-chainsaw...?

56
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,019
A devil.

57
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,995
If you're gonna kill me, just do it. \NI'm dead either way.

58
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,020
It's hurt?

59
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,028
You're gonna die, too?

60
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,987
Bite me!

61
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:41,080
I heard that drinking blood heals a devil.

62
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,106
If you don't wanna die, bite me!

63
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,096
My blood's not free, though. This is a deal!

64
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,021
I'll help you...

65
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,026
So, you help me.

66
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,034
Because I don't wanna die, after all.

67
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:28,072
Why don't you hire me as a devil hunter?

68
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,061
Too hungry to sleep.

69
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,002
When I can't sleep, \NI start thinking about money,

70
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,073
and then it's even harder to sleep.

71
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,068
I know what dream I wanna have when I sleep.

72
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,074
Gonna put jam on my bread, \Nand share it with you.

73
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:55,048
Then I'm gonna flirt with a girl...

74
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:59,033
I'll play video games with her, and then \Nwe'll fall asleep hugging each other.

75
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,059
Sounds sweet, right?

76
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:22,105
Y'know, I heard my mom died from some \Nheart disease that made her cough up blood.

77
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,076
Got a devil for you, Denji. Time for work.

78
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:52,028
Wish they'd at least let me dream...

79
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,061
There's a devil in here, huh?

80
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,025
I don't see anything.

81
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,051
You think it's hiding?

82
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,071
Or maybe it left already?

83
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:50,030
Denji, my boy... we're pretty \Ngrateful to you, y'know?

84
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,050
Yeah?

85
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,004
You're as loyal as a dog,

86
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,070
and you work for cheap like one, too.

87
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,103
Only problem with dogs \Nis I can't stand the stench.

88
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:23,045
Even yakuza think about getting bigger \Nand making more money, kid.

89
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,070
So we did like you, \Nand made a deal with a devil.

90
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:34,016
We wanted demonic power...

91
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,085
And I want devil hunters...

92
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,034
Dead!

93
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:45,984
Y'know, little devil hunter, \Nthese guys are dumb as hell.

94
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,036
Total suckers!

95
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:54,023
I offer them a bit of demonic power, \Nand they offer to become my slaves...

96
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,065
Even though the power \Nturns them into zombies.

97
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,037
See, because I'm the Zombie Devil.

98
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,106
And I hate devil hunters, because you\N go around killing us devils.

99
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,032
So I'm gonna kill you.

100
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:14,006
Boys, tear him apart \Nand toss him in the trash.

101
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,021
Shit!

102
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,026
How do I get out of here?

103
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,996
Get off!

104
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,056
It's not like I'm asking to be rich.

105
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:11,018
All I want is a normal life!

106
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,066
And I can't even have that?!

107
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,024
Pochita...

108
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,068
Pochita!

109
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,019
Pochita, time for work.

110
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:19,086
Pochita, there's a good chance \NI'm gonna die fighting a devil.

111
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,041
My only regret would be \Nleaving you on your own.

112
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,017
You could end up starving to death...

113
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,056
Or some other devil hunter might kill you.

114
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:39,043
I've heard some devils \Ncan take over dead bodies.

115
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:45,042
If that's something you can do... \Nthen I want you to have my body.

116
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,990
The yakuza won't be on your case \Nif you wait until I've been buried, right?

117
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,002
And then you could move \Nout of here... and then...

118
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:57,984
Yeah.

119
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:02,060
I want you to live a normal life, \Nand die a normal death.

120
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,021
You've gotta make my dream come true.

121
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,011
Pochita?

122
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,000
Did you take my body, like I said?

123
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,067
I always loved hearing you talk \Nabout your dreams, Denji.

124
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:56,095
Here's the deal. I'll give you my heart...

125
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:01,071
And in exchange, I want you \Nto show me your dream.

126
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,054
Pochita?!

127
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,047
I'm not hurt?

128
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,064
Pochita...?

129
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,037
What is this?

130
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,079
You're alive after being sliced up?

131
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,035
Why? Gross!

132
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,056
I seriously hate devil hunters.

133
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,097
Guys, go ahead and eat him.

134
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:50,000
These guys had plenty already, \Nso why'd they want even more?

135
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,039
Am I the same?

136
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,066
I wasn't satisfied with \Nthe happiness I had with Pochita.

137
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,085
I kept dreaming about a better life.

138
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,050
I guess we all dream \Nabout stuff like that, huh?

139
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,068
I can't blame you, then.

140
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,042
And I won't, but...

141
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,092
If you get in our way?

142
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:19,071
You'll die!

143
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,074
He's bound to stay dead after being eaten.

144
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:05,079
What are you?!

145
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:09,086
Did that devil runt take your body?!

146
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,054
That means you're one of us!

147
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,087
Ow...

148
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,056
It hurts!

149
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,041
Stay away!

150
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,023
Move!

151
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,036
Stay back! Back! Get away!

152
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,090
Stay away! Don't do it!

153
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:06,082
Don't come near me!

154
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,076
Die!

155
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:04,020
I guess you guys went full devil, huh?

156
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,006
Well, you hired me to be a devil hunter.

157
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:12,047
So, I better kill all the devils, right?!

158
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,025
Oh, yeah!

159
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,029
Once you're all dead...

160
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,062
I won't owe a damn thing!

161
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,049
Someone got here before us.

162
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,021
There's still one alive.

163
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,022
You've got a strange smell.

164
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,049
Not like a human or a devil.

165
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,074
I take it you did this?

166
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:57,016
H-Hug me...

167
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,043
He's human.

168
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,020
Any chance he's possessed?

169
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,001
No.

170
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,017
I can tell who's possessed \Nwith a look at their face.

171
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,985
I came here to kill the Zombie Devil.

172
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,022
I'm a devil hunter with Public Safety.

173
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,113
You have two options:

174
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,071
I can kill you like a devil,

175
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,013
or I can keep you as a human.

176
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:50,021

When you say that...
