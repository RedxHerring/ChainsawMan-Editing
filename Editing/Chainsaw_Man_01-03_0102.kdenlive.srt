1
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:54,071
Better head to work.

2
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,012
It's about 60,000 a month \Nfor cutting down trees, right?

3
00:01:20,088 --> 00:01:25,025
Then there's the kidney I sold. \NThat was 1.2 million.

4
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:29,048
My right eye was 300,000.

5
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:32,037
Sold one of my nuts...

6
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:37,022
How much was that, again? \NI think... not even 100,000.

7
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:42,087
And I still owe...

8
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,087
About 38,040,000 yen.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,005
I heard you, Pochita.

10
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:54,085
Let's kill this thing already.

11
00:01:55,088 --> 00:02:00,072
A dead devil's usually good \Nfor about 300,000...

12
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:07,042
Devil hunting pays the best, easy.

13
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,097
Gotta be the Tomato Devil.

14
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,037
He'll revive from the seeds, \Nso you'll wanna burn those.

15
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,991
Nice work, Denji.

16
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:38,032
This carcass will bring in a fair \Nprice on the black market.

17
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,028
I'll pay you 400,000.

18
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,028
Hey, thanks!

19
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,059
After what you owe and \Nthe interest, that leaves 170,000.

20
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:47,050
So after the finder's fee, admin fee,

21
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:52,027
management costs, and so on...

22
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,076
Leaves me with 70,000.

23
00:02:55,008 --> 00:03:01,042
After the water bill, \Nand some other stuff I owe...

24
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,106
Funny how that works.

25
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,051
I've got 1,800 yen left.

26
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:13,073
No food at home, and this is gonna \Nhave to last us a month, so...

27
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,999
Pochita, looks like dinner's \Ngonna be a slice of bread.

28
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,995
Why hire a brat like that to hunt devils?

29
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,998
He's paying off what he owes us.

30
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,084
Well, technically, it was \Nhis deadbeat old man's debt.

31
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:40,013
And a kid with a pet devil \Ncan get the job done?

32
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,028
The thing about real devil hunters is...

33
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:47,091
They don't pass devil \Ncarcasses onto the yakuza.

34
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:52,025
Besides, the best thing about Denji \Nis he does what he's told.

35
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,032
Hey, dog!

36
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,077
I'll give you 100 yen to eat this cigarette.

37
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,001
For real?

38
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,085
Don't mind if I do.

39
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,036
We'll be in touch \Nwhen there's another devil.

40
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,100
Try and run, and you're pig slop.

41
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,075
That'll keep us for another three days.

42
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,061
The other day I heard...

43
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:47,000
That normally, people put jam \Non their bread, before eating it.

44
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:51,045
Normal's just a dream for us, though.

45
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,084
Doubt I'll pay off this debt before I die.

46
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,101
Probably gonna die without \Never having a girlfriend, too.

47
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:06,076
Not like I could invite a girl to this dump.

48
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,101
No money to go on dates, either.

49
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,981
If I could have one dream come true...

50
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,050
I wanna score with a girl before I die.

51
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:38,055
Bastard hung himself {\i1}without{\i0} \Npaying this month's installment first.

52
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,049
Boy, you've got until tomorrow \Nto put 700,000 together.

53
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,030
You can beg for it, whore yourself out...\N I don't care. Get it done.

54
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,055
Otherwise, we chop you up and sell the bits.

55
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,019
A ch-chainsaw...?

56
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,019
A devil.

57
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,995
If you're gonna kill me, just do it. \NI'm dead either way.

58
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,020
It's hurt?

59
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,028
You're gonna die, too?

60
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,987
Bite me!

61
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:41,080
I heard that drinking blood heals a devil.

62
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,106
If you don't wanna die, bite me!

63
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,096
My blood's not free, though. This is a deal!

64
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,021
I'll help you...

65
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,026
So, you help me.

66
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,034
Because I don't wanna die, after all.

67
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:28,072
Why don't you hire me as a devil hunter?

68
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,061
Too hungry to sleep.

69
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,002
When I can't sleep, \NI start thinking about money,

70
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,073
and then it's even harder to sleep.

71
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,068
I know what dream I wanna have when I sleep.

72
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,074
Gonna put jam on my bread, \Nand share it with you.

73
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:55,048
Then I'm gonna flirt with a girl...

74
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:59,033
I'll play video games with her, and then \Nwe'll fall asleep hugging each other.

75
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,059
Sounds sweet, right?

76
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:22,105
Y'know, I heard my mom died from some \Nheart disease that made her cough up blood.

77
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,076
Got a devil for you, Denji. Time for work.

78
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:52,028
Wish they'd at least let me dream...

79
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,061
There's a devil in here, huh?

80
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,025
I don't see anything.

81
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,051
You think it's hiding?

82
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,071
Or maybe it left already?

83
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:50,030
Denji, my boy... we're pretty \Ngrateful to you, y'know?

84
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,050
Yeah?

85
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,004
You're as loyal as a dog,

86
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,070
and you work for cheap like one, too.

87
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,103
Only problem with dogs \Nis I can't stand the stench.

88
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:23,045
Even yakuza think about getting bigger \Nand making more money, kid.

89
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,070
So we did like you, \Nand made a deal with a devil.

90
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:34,016
We wanted demonic power...

91
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,085
And I want devil hunters...

92
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,034
Dead!

93
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:45,984
Y'know, little devil hunter, \Nthese guys are dumb as hell.

94
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,036
Total suckers!

95
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:54,023
I offer them a bit of demonic power, \Nand they offer to become my slaves...

96
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,065
Even though the power \Nturns them into zombies.

97
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,037
See, because I'm the Zombie Devil.

98
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:04,106
And I hate devil hunters, because you\N go around killing us devils.

99
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,032
So I'm gonna kill you.

100
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:14,006
Boys, tear him apart \Nand toss him in the trash.

101
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,021
Shit!

102
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,026
How do I get out of here?

103
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,996
Get off!

104
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,056
It's not like I'm asking to be rich.

105
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:11,018
All I want is a normal life!

106
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,066
And I can't even have that?!

107
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,024
Pochita...

108
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,068
Pochita!

109
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,019
Pochita, time for work.

110
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:19,086
Pochita, there's a good chance \NI'm gonna die fighting a devil.

111
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,041
My only regret would be \Nleaving you on your own.

112
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,017
You could end up starving to death...

113
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,056
Or some other devil hunter might kill you.

114
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:39,043
I've heard some devils \Ncan take over dead bodies.

115
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:45,042
If that's something you can do... \Nthen I want you to have my body.

116
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,990
The yakuza won't be on your case \Nif you wait until I've been buried, right?

117
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,002
And then you could move \Nout of here... and then...

118
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:57,984
Yeah.

119
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:02,060
I want you to live a normal life, \Nand die a normal death.

120
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,021
You've gotta make my dream come true.

121
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,011
Pochita?

122
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,000
Did you take my body, like I said?

123
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,067
I always loved hearing you talk \Nabout your dreams, Denji.

124
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:56,095
Here's the deal. I'll give you my heart...

125
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:01,071
And in exchange, I want you \Nto show me your dream.

126
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,054
Pochita?!

127
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,047
I'm not hurt?

128
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,064
Pochita...?

129
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,037
What is this?

130
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,079
You're alive after being sliced up?

131
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,035
Why? Gross!

132
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,056
I seriously hate devil hunters.

133
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,097
Guys, go ahead and eat him.

134
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:50,000
These guys had plenty already, \Nso why'd they want even more?

135
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,039
Am I the same?

136
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,066
I wasn't satisfied with \Nthe happiness I had with Pochita.

137
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,085
I kept dreaming about a better life.

138
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,050
I guess we all dream \Nabout stuff like that, huh?

139
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,068
I can't blame you, then.

140
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,042
And I won't, but...

141
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,092
If you get in our way?

142
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:19,071
You'll die!

143
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,074
He's bound to stay dead after being eaten.

144
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:05,079
What are you?!

145
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:09,086
Did that devil runt take your body?!

146
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,054
That means you're one of us!

147
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,087
Ow...

148
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,056
It hurts!

149
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,041
Stay away!

150
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,023
Move!

151
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,036
Stay back! Back! Get away!

152
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,090
Stay away! Don't do it!

153
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:06,082
Don't come near me!

154
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,076
Die!

155
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:04,020
I guess you guys went full devil, huh?

156
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,006
Well, you hired me to be a devil hunter.

157
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:12,047
So, I better kill all the devils, right?!

158
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,025
Oh, yeah!

159
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,029
Once you're all dead...

160
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,062
I won't owe a damn thing!

161
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,049
Someone got here before us.

162
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,021
There's still one alive.

163
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,022
You've got a strange smell.

164
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,049
Not like a human or a devil.

165
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,074
I take it you did this?

166
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:57,016
H-Hug me...

167
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,043
He's human.

168
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,020
Any chance he's possessed?

169
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,001
No.

170
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,017
I can tell who's possessed \Nwith a look at their face.

171
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,985
I came here to kill the Zombie Devil.

172
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,022
I'm a devil hunter with Public Safety.

173
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,113
You have two options:

174
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,071
I can kill you like a devil,

175
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,013
or I can keep you as a human.

176
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:50,021
If I keep you, I'll make sure you're fed.

177
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,035
When you say that...

178
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,075
Like, what's for breakfast?

179
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:10,987
Bread with butter and jam, salad, coffee...

180
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:15,009
And then maybe something \Nfor dessert, I think?

181
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,038
That sounds awesome.

182
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,262
That was my stomach.

183
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,208
What's your name?

184
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,246
It's Denji!

185
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,232
I need to tell you something right now.

186
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,246
From now on, you're in my care, Denji.

187
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:54,239
I expect "yes" or "woof" for answers. \NI don't need a dog that says "no."

188
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,201
When you say that...

189
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,190
Someone in forensics once told me...

190
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:05,188
That when we get dogs that \Naren't helpful, we put them down.

191
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,251
I thought she was nice.

192
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:15,188
I kind of liked her.

193
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,174
I had no idea she was scary like this.

194
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,265
Treating me like a damn dog...

195
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,202
I just remembered how Pochita's dead.

196
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:38,253
{\c&H736C5F&\pos(330,125)}General

197
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:38,251
We haven't had breakfast yet, either. \NLet's grab something at the rest area.

198
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,281
Sorry, but I don't have any cash.

199
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,253
Just pick what you want. I'll pay.

200
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,233
And you're conspicuous \Nwithout a shirt on, so wear this.

201
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,264
Here.

202
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:03,197
All my life people have avoided me, \Nsaying I'm filthy and smell bad.

203
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,247
No one's ever been nice to me before.

204
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,230
Much less a girl who looks this good!

205
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,207
I love her!

206
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,240
I'll take some udon...

207
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,197
Udon and... a sausage!

208
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,219
Is that cool?

209
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,244
Sure is. I'll take a curry udon, please.

210
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,276
Coming up.

211
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:01,197
Oh, that sounds good, too...

212
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,195
Whoa, there.

213
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,235
Denji? You okay?

214
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,198
You smell good.

215
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,264
How much will it be?

216
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,207
Gimme one sec...

217
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,197
Denji?

218
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,277
It'll be 1,100 yen, all together.

219
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,252
The chainsaws cut me up, too,

220
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,196
Here's 2,000.

221
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,222
so I think I'm a little \Nlow on blood right now.

222
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,196
How did you end up like this?

223
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,280
I had a pet devil, and he replaced my heart.

224
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,227
Kinda hard to believe, huh?

225
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,274
I don't really wanna believe it, either.

226
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,194
Pochita dying for my sake...

227
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:42,201
There's not a lot of precedent \Nfor your condition,

228
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,229
even from a historical perspective.

229
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,251
It doesn't even have a name.

230
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:52,161
I believe you.

231
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,275
I've got a particularly good sense of smell.

232
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,235
So I can tell.

233
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:03,193
Your best friend is alive inside of you.

234
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,176
Not in the sentimental sense, either.

235
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:09,191
Your body has the scents \Nof both a human and a devil.

236
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,234
Is that right?

237
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,280
That's awesome!

238
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:15,191
Really... awesome...

239
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,249
Udon?!

240
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,208
The udon?

241
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:35,200
Is it cool if I eat my udon?

242
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:39,225
Are you all right? \NCan you eat on your own?

243
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,201
I can...

244
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,226
I can not.

245
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:46,160
Here. Say, "Ahh."

246
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,173
Ahh...

247
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,241
Is it good?

248
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,250
Woof!

249
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:56,177
You are really sweet to be \Nenjoying soggy udon this much.

250
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,255
A lot like a dog, actually.

251
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,216
Um... what's your name?

252
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,235
Makima.

253
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:11,232
Miss Makima... is there a type\N of guy you l-like?

254
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,254
I'm into the "Denji" type.

255
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,257
Denji?

256
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,251
Dude, that's me.

257
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,182
Is there a type of guy you like?

258
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,223
I'm into the "Denji" type.

259
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:46,224
I like you, too, Miss Makima.

260
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,226
Denji? This way, come on.

261
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,254
This is the Tokyo headquarters \Nfor our Devil Hunters.

262
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:05,208
There are over a thousand Devil Hunters \Nin Tokyo, including civilians,

263
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:09,246
but Public Safety has the best benefits \Nand a lot of paid vacation time.

264
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,180
If Miss Makima likes me...

265
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:20,220
Then maybe, if we work together, \Nwe'll eventually get together?

266
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:25,282
And if we get together... \Nwe can {\i1}get together{\i0}, right?

267
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,247
I wanna! I wanna get together \Nwith her real bad!

268
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,269
Denji...

269
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,183
Yeah?

270
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,259
We're supposed to \Nwear uniforms, so put this on.

271
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,255
Once you've changed, \NI'll introduce you to a coworker.

272
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:54,230
This is Aki Hayakawa. He started \Nthree years before you, Denji.

273
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,241
You're going to be shadowing him today.

274
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,180
I'm not working with you, Miss Makima?

275
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,219
That should be obvious.

276
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,209
You're not even in her league.

277
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,185
Time for patrol.

278
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,200
No! Miss Makima!

279
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,229
Damn it, get up.

280
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,265
No way! I wanna work with Miss Makima!

281
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:23,175
If you do a good job, \Nwe can work together someday.

282
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,166
So, do that, okay?

283
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,163
Hey, big man.

284
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,229
Does Miss Makima have a boyfriend?

285
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,230
Hey, come on.

286
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,226
Hey!

287
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,196
Come with me.

288
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,218
You need to quit this job.

289
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,244
Show up tomorrow, \Nand I'll kick your ass again.

290
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,244
Why, though?

291
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,234
Look, I'm trying to be nice, here.

292
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:36,180
People who start this job without \Nthinking it through end up dead.

293
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:40,192
I've had colleagues who got \Ninto devil hunting for the payday,

294
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,228
and it got them all killed by devils.

295
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:47,211
The survivors are the ones \Nwith real motivation.

296
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:52,233
You're just after Makima, right? \NThat's why you took the job?

297
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,236
Ding-ding!

298
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,234
Then I'm glad I hit you.

299
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:07,268
I'll let her know that you ran off, \Nscared away by the devils.

300
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,238
You really are a nice guy, huh?

301
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:30,218
Because... when I fight a dude...

302
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:34,178
It's nuts... or nothing!

303
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,269
I had udon for the first time today, man.

304
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,230
A sausage, too.

305
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:49,208
Got treated like a decent \Nhuman being for the first time,

306
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,242
and even had someone pay for my meal.

307
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,239
It's like a dream come true for me.

308
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:59,243
I didn't really think it through \Nwhen I started devil hunting,

309
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,230
but if I get to keep up this kind of life?

310
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,198
I don't care if it kills me.

311
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,242
Actually, y'know, I take it back.

312
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,242
It's not just {italicize for emphasis}my{/i} life, anymore.

313
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,207
Makima...

314
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:23,174
is not the kind of woman \Na punk like you should be chasing!

315
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,219
What the hell are you saying?

316
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:29,227
Sounds to me like you just like her, too!

317
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,219
You... really did...

318
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:41,274
Only aim... for my balls...

319
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,189
Shit.

320
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:54,196
The big guy's testicles were attacked \Nby the Nut Devil, ma'am!

321
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,170
That's a lie. He's lying.

322
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,263
So, do you think you two can work together?

323
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,247
No way!

324
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,217
He's a piece of trash!

325
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,255
I'm glad you two are hitting it off.

326
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,219
Denji, you're going to \Nbe joining Hayakawa's unit.

327
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,232
Unit?

328
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,268
This punk?!

329
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,186
I've already got enough \Ntroublemakers, don't I?

330
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,203
Adding another... I don't know...

331
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,249
I told you when I put it together, right?

332
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:27,183
Your team's an experimental one, \Noperating differently from the usual method.

333
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,165
What exactly is he, ma'am?

334
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:36,218
Denji's human, but can \Ntransform into a devil.

335
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,189
Damn right! Pretty sweet, huh?

336
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,185
And that's the truth?

337
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:44,184
I always figured those stories \Nwere baseless rumors.

338
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,218
He's special.

339
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,241
Which is why he's going to be \Nreceiving special treatment.

340
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:55,253
If he tries to resign, \Nor becomes insubordinate...

341
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,261
Denji will be disposed of as a devil.

342
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,235
Uh, what's that mean?

343
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,224
It means we're working \Ntogether until you die.

344
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,209
You're going to be living with me \Nso I can keep an eye on you.

345
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,205
Just remember, they said I can \Nkill you if you try to run off.

346
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:28,181
Hey, is Miss Makima a bad person?

347
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:31,223
If you think that's the case, \Nthen give up on her.

348
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:35,225
If you're really a devil, you should \Njust be grateful she doesn't kill you.

349
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,280
We're Devil Hunters, got that?

350
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,258
So, she's a good person, then?

351
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,189
Of course she is.

352
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,222
She saved my life.

353
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,223
Miss Makima...

354
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,250
I hope I get to hug her again.

355
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:08,256
Strawberry jam, plum jam, orange jam...

356
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:12,184
Then some butter and honey, plus...

357
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,162
Let's throw some cinnamon on, too.

358
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,239
I got the best toast ever right here!

359
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,281
So good!

360
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,176
It's freaking fantastic!

361
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:36,223
How long are you gonna be in there?!

362
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,226
Don't fall asleep on the toilet!

363
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,249
A Fiend has been reported \Nin an east Nerima residence.

364
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:58,216
Civilian evacuation and cordon \Nare both complete.

365
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:02,192
The Fiend in question has \Nholed up in a second story room.

366
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,185
We'll leave it to you \NDevil Hunters from here.

367
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:06,287
Is this a new rookie, Hayakawa?

368
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,238
Hey, what's a Fiend?

369
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:17,238
Did you never go to school or something?

370
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:19,216
Nah, man, no.

371
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,253
When a devil takes control \Nof a human corpse, you get a Fiend.

372
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,172
Wait, doesn't that make me a Fiend?

373
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,245
No. Fiends always have characteristic heads.

374
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,202
Should be obvious enough once we see him.

375
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:47,269
The devil controls a Fiend's personality.\N You kill this one.

376
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,203
Turn into a devil, \Nand show me what you can do.

377
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,197
That'll help me figure out \Nif you're of any use.

378
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,215
Don't look at me...

379
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:58,182
You're dead! Dead, dead, dead!

380
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,254
Damn Devil Hunters!

381
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:11,263
Hey. Why didn't you use your devil powers?

382
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:13,220
Thing is...

383
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:18,230
When I kill devils with my powers, \Nthey get real messed up.

384
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:24,279
So, like... I coulda ended up \Nlike this Fiend, right?

385
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:29,227
So I kinda... wanted to \Nmake it painless for him.

386
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,234
All right. Listen to me.

387
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,212
Fiends are just like any other devil.

388
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,240
If you're hunting them, \Nthen drop the sympathy.

389
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:42,165
My entire family was killed \Nby a devil right in front of me.

390
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,240
I've had drinks with the cops down below.

391
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:49,219
They're risking their lives \Nto protect their wives and kids.

392
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,226
Everyone is serious about this except you.

393
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,222
I'd rather make any devil I kill \Nsuffer as much as possible.

394
00:38:57,209 --> 00:39:00,278
What are you trying to do? \NMake friends with them?

395
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:05,269
If there's a devil I could be \Nfriends with, then yeah, I would.

396
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,196
'Cuz I don't have any friends.

397
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:15,183
I'll remember that.

398
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,208
Guess I pissed him off...

399
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:30,161
I was just trying to keep \Nblood off these dirty magazines.

400
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:34,225
When the chainsaws are out, blood gets \Neverywhere and makes a real mess.

401
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:38,204
I made it easy for you, \Nso I get to keep these!

402
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,246
Okay, the porn is secured.

403
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,201
I want you to show me your dream.

404
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:52,203
I'm pretty serious about this, Pochita.

405
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:56,200
I'm already living the dream, \Njust like our bargain said.

406
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:59,224
I'll remember that.

407
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:04,266
My dream might've come true already, \Nbut he must be chasing his.

408
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:10,279
I get to bathe every day, eat good food...

409
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:13,222
Get to hang around a hot chick...

410
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:18,210
My life's a 10 outta 10, but it feels \Nlike something's missing.

411
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:22,199
Am I missing something? Something that'd\N give me a real perfect score?

412
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,266
He's gotta be after some revenge shit.

413
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,247
They're trying to protect their families.

414
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,244
I wonder if Miss Makima \Nis after anything like that?

415
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,165
Miss Makima...

416
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:39,231
I wanna touch her boobs.

417
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:48,217
Touching boobs is a dream I gave\N up on a long time ago,

418
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,267
but I've got a real job now. \NMaybe I could pull it off?

419
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,234
I probably couldn't score \Nwith a girl just yet.

420
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,240
But boobs?

421
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:01,247
If I had the right plan, and the\N willpower, then maybe...

422
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,243
Everyone is serious about this except you.

423
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,201
So that's what he meant!

424
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,258
I've found it! Something to be serious about!

425
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,215
My goal! It's...

426
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,229
Boobs!

427
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,206
Boobs?

428
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:19,198
Hey! Pay attention, dumbass!

429
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,186
Listen to what?

430
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,236
I'm assigning you a partner \Nstarting today, Denji.

431
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,186
Partner?

432
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,202
As a precaution, Public Safety executes patrols

433
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:32,270
and smaller missions with two-person teams.

434
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,161
This is great timing. She's here.

435
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:40,210
Be careful. She's a Fiend.

436
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:44,231
Prostrate yourselves, humans!

437
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,194
For I am Power!

438
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,220
Are you to be my so-called partner?!

439
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,229
Power?! Your name's Power?!

440
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,198
And you're a Fiend?!

441
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,166
Are Fiends allowed to be Devil Hunters?!

442
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,163
Well, whatever! Nice to meet you!

443
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,212
Fiends, like devils, \Nare targets for extermination.

444
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,280
But Power's highly rational,

445
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:11,202
so she's been on Hayakawa's team.

446
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,196
I mentioned this before,

447
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,236
but Public Safety Devil Extermination \NSpecial Division 4 is an experimental unit.

448
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,225
The higher-ups will be looking \Nto dissolve your team as soon as possible

449
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,215
if you can't get results.

450
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:26,240
I don't need to explain what would happen \Nto you two if that happens, do I?

451
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,249
Power's horns stand out a bit too much,

452
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,287
so you'll want to patrol areas \Nwithout a lot of pedestrians.

453
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,233
Human! Provide me with something \Nto kill immediately!

454
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,257
I am starved for blood!

455
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:01,206
I can put up with crazy, \Nas long as she's hot enough.

456
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,217
The question is, how do I get \Nmy hands on those boobs?

457
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,287
If you run into any civilian Devil Hunters,

458
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:14,179
or the police try to question you \Nabout what you're doing...

459
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,176
We've got a pair of suspicious individuals...

460
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,214
Excuse me, I need to ask you—

461
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:17,199
We're with Public Safety Devil \NExtermination Special Division 4.

462
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,211
...say that, show them your ID,

463
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,216
and they'll make a sour face \Nand leave you alone.

464
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,232
Where the hell are all the devils?!

465
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:29,237
This is likely my fault!

466
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:33,248
Before becoming a Fiend, \NI was a devil that was feared by all!

467
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:37,186
Demonic peons will likely flee \Nthe moment they catch my scent!

468
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:40,185
Wait, how are we gonna \Nget anything done, then?!

469
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:44,276
If you have any questions, \Njust ask Hayakawa.

470
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,258
He's the one who put you two together.

471
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:51,187
That asshole! He set me up!

472
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:54,211
He stuck me with Power \Nso I can't do anything cool!

473
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,233
He's trying to get me fired!

474
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,255
The scent of blood!

475
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:06,198
Whoa! Hey, crazy, where you going?!

476
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:12,199
The game is afoot!

477
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,255
The battle is joined!

478
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,287
Damn, she's fast!

479
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:18,252
The scene's evacuated and blocked off.

480
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:21,225
It's the Sea Cucumber Devil. \NYes, the Sea Cucumber Devil.

481
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:24,205
Requesting backup \Nin front of Nerima Station.

482
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,208
I said, it's the Sea Cucumber—

483
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,187
Do you know what a sea cucumber is?

484
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,243
Look, I'm trying to say—

485
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,223
What the...?

486
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:40,285
Did you see?! The kill is mine!
