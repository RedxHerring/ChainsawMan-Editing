1
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:54,071
Better head to work.

2
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,012
It's about 60,000 a month \Nfor cutting down trees, right?

3
00:01:20,088 --> 00:01:25,025
Then there's the kidney I sold. \NThat was 1.2 million.

4
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:29,048
My right eye was 300,000.

5
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:32,037
Sold one of my nuts...

6
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:37,022
How much was that, again? \NI think... not even 100,000.

7
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:42,087
And I still owe...

8
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,087
About 38,040,000 yen.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,005
I heard you, Pochita.

10
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:54,085
Let's kill this thing already.

11
00:01:55,088 --> 00:02:00,072
A dead devil's usually good \Nfor about 300,000...

12
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:07,042
Devil hunting pays the best, easy.

13
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,264
Gotta be the Tomato Devil.

14
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,204
He'll revive from the seeds, \Nso you'll wanna burn those.

15
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,158
Nice work, Denji.

16
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,198
This carcass will bring in a fair \Nprice on the black market.

17
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,195
I'll pay you 400,000.

18
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,195
Hey, thanks!

19
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,226
After what you owe and \Nthe interest, that leaves 170,000.

20
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:47,217
So after the finder's fee, admin fee,

21
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,194
management costs, and so on...

22
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,243
Leaves me with 70,000.

23
00:02:55,174 --> 00:03:01,208
After the water bill, \Nand some other stuff I owe...

24
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,273
Funny how that works.

25
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,218
I've got 1,800 yen left.

26
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:13,240
No food at home, and this is gonna \Nhave to last us a month, so...

27
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,166
Pochita, looks like dinner's \Ngonna be a slice of bread.

28
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:28,161
Why hire a brat like that to hunt devils?

29
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,165
He's paying off what he owes us.

30
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,251
Well, technically, it was \Nhis deadbeat old man's debt.

31
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:40,180
And a kid with a pet devil \Ncan get the job done?

32
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:43,195
The thing about real devil hunters is...

33
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:47,258
They don't pass devil \Ncarcasses onto the yakuza.

34
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:52,192
Besides, the best thing about Denji \Nis he does what he's told.

35
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,198
Hey, dog!

36
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,244
I'll give you 100 yen to eat this cigarette.

37
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:07,167
For real?

38
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,252
Don't mind if I do.

39
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,203
We'll be in touch \Nwhen there's another devil.

40
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,267
Try and run, and you're pig slop.

41
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,241
That'll keep us for another three days.

42
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,228
The other day I heard...

43
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,167
That normally, people put jam \Non their bread, before eating it.

44
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:51,212
Normal's just a dream for us, though.

45
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,251
Doubt I'll pay off this debt before I die.

46
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,268
Probably gonna die without \Never having a girlfriend, too.

47
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,243
Not like I could invite a girl to this dump.

48
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,268
No money to go on dates, either.

49
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,148
If I could have one dream come true...

50
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,217
I wanna score with a girl before I die.

51
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:38,221
Bastard hung himself {\i1}without{\i0} \Npaying this month's installment first.

52
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,216
Boy, you've got until tomorrow \Nto put 700,000 together.

53
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,196
You can beg for it, whore yourself out...\N I don't care. Get it done.

54
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,222
Otherwise, we chop you up and sell the bits.

55
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,185
A ch-chainsaw...?

56
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,186
A devil.

57
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:17,162
If you're gonna kill me, just do it. \NI'm dead either way.

58
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,186
It's hurt?

59
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,195
You're gonna die, too?

60
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,154
Bite me!

61
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,247
I heard that drinking blood heals a devil.

62
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,273
If you don't wanna die, bite me!

63
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:00,263
My blood's not free, though. This is a deal!

64
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,188
I'll help you...

65
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,193
So, you help me.

66
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,201
Because I don't wanna die, after all.

67
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:28,239
Why don't you hire me as a devil hunter?

68
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,228
Too hungry to sleep.

69
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,169
When I can't sleep, \NI start thinking about money,

70
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,240
and then it's even harder to sleep.

71
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,235
I know what dream I wanna have when I sleep.

72
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,241
Gonna put jam on my bread, \Nand share it with you.

73
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,215
Then I'm gonna flirt with a girl...

74
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:59,200
I'll play video games with her, and then \Nwe'll fall asleep hugging each other.

75
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,226
Sounds sweet, right?

76
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:22,272
Y'know, I heard my mom died from some \Nheart disease that made her cough up blood.

77
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,243
Got a devil for you, Denji. Time for work.

78
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:52,195
Wish they'd at least let me dream...

79
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,228
There's a devil in here, huh?

80
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,192
I don't see anything.

81
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,218
You think it's hiding?

82
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,238
Or maybe it left already?

83
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:50,196
Denji, my boy... we're pretty \Ngrateful to you, y'know?

84
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,217
Yeah?

85
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,171
You're as loyal as a dog,

86
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:58,236
and you work for cheap like one, too.

87
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,270
Only problem with dogs \Nis I can't stand the stench.

88
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:23,212
Even yakuza think about getting bigger \Nand making more money, kid.

89
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:27,236
So we did like you, \Nand made a deal with a devil.

90
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:34,182
We wanted demonic power...

91
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,251
And I want devil hunters...

92
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,201
Dead!

93
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:46,151
Y'know, little devil hunter, \Nthese guys are dumb as hell.

94
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,203
Total suckers!

95
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:54,189
I offer them a bit of demonic power, \Nand they offer to become my slaves...

96
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,232
Even though the power \Nturns them into zombies.

97
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,203
See, because I'm the Zombie Devil.

98
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,273
And I hate devil hunters, because you\N go around killing us devils.

99
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,198
So I'm gonna kill you.

100
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:14,172
Boys, tear him apart \Nand toss him in the trash.

101
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,188
Shit!

102
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,192
How do I get out of here?

103
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,163
Get off!

104
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,223
It's not like I'm asking to be rich.

105
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:11,185
All I want is a normal life!

106
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,233
And I can't even have that?!

107
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,191
Pochita...

108
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,235
Pochita!

109
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,186
Pochita, time for work.

110
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:19,253
Pochita, there's a good chance \NI'm gonna die fighting a devil.

111
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,208
My only regret would be \Nleaving you on your own.

112
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,184
You could end up starving to death...

113
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,223
Or some other devil hunter might kill you.

114
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:39,210
I've heard some devils \Ncan take over dead bodies.

115
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:45,209
If that's something you can do... \Nthen I want you to have my body.

116
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,157
The yakuza won't be on your case \Nif you wait until I've been buried, right?

117
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:56,169
And then you could move \Nout of here... and then...

118
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,151
Yeah.

119
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:02,227
I want you to live a normal life, \Nand die a normal death.

120
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,188
You've gotta make my dream come true.

121
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,177
Pochita?

122
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,166
Did you take my body, like I said?

123
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:50,233
I always loved hearing you talk \Nabout your dreams, Denji.

124
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,262
Here's the deal. I'll give you my heart...

125
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:01,237
And in exchange, I want you \Nto show me your dream.

126
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,221
Pochita?!

127
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,213
I'm not hurt?

128
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,230
Pochita...?

129
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,203
What is this?

130
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,245
You're alive after being sliced up?

131
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,201
Why? Gross!

132
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:35,222
I seriously hate devil hunters.

133
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,264
Guys, go ahead and eat him.

134
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:50,166
These guys had plenty already, \Nso why'd they want even more?

135
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,206
Am I the same?

136
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,233
I wasn't satisfied with \Nthe happiness I had with Pochita.

137
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,252
I kept dreaming about a better life.

138
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,217
I guess we all dream \Nabout stuff like that, huh?

139
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,235
I can't blame you, then.

140
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,208
And I won't, but...

141
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,259
If you get in our way?

142
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:19,237
You'll die!

143
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,241
He's bound to stay dead after being eaten.

144
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,246
What are you?!

145
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,253
Did that devil runt take your body?!

146
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,221
That means you're one of us!

147
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,254
Ow...

148
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,222
It hurts!

149
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,208
Stay away!

150
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,189
Move!

151
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,203
Stay back! Back! Get away!

152
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,257
Stay away! Don't do it!

153
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,249
Don't come near me!

154
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,243
Die!

155
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:04,187
I guess you guys went full devil, huh?

156
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,173
Well, you hired me to be a devil hunter.

157
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:12,214
So, I better kill all the devils, right?!

158
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,192
Oh, yeah!

159
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,196
Once you're all dead...

160
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,229
I won't owe a damn thing!

161
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:13,216
Someone got here before us.

162
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,188
There's still one alive.

163
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,189
You've got a strange smell.

164
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,216
Not like a human or a devil.

165
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,241
I take it you did this?

166
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:57,183
H-Hug me...

167
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,210
He's human.

168
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,186
Any chance he's possessed?

169
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,168
No.

170
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,183
I can tell who's possessed \Nwith a look at their face.

171
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:30,152
I came here to kill the Zombie Devil.

172
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,188
I'm a devil hunter with Public Safety.

173
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,280
You have two options:

174
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,238
I can kill you like a devil,

175
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:46,180
or I can keep you as a human.

176
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:50,188
If I keep you, I'll make sure you're fed.

177
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,202
When you say that...

178
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,242
Like, what's for breakfast?

179
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,154
Bread with butter and jam, salad, coffee...

180
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:15,176
And then maybe something \Nfor dessert, I think?

181
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:26,204
That sounds awesome.

182
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,346
That was my stomach.

183
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,292
What's your name?

184
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,331
It's Denji!

185
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,317
I need to tell you something right now.

186
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:50,330
From now on, you're in my care, Denji.

187
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:55,323
I expect "yes" or "woof" for answers. \NI don't need a dog that says "no."

188
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,286
When you say that...

189
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,274
Someone in forensics once told me...

190
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:06,273
That when we get dogs that \Naren't helpful, we put them down.

191
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,335
I thought she was nice.

192
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,273
I kind of liked her.

193
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:19,258
I had no idea she was scary like this.

194
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,349
Treating me like a damn dog...

195
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:30,286
I just remembered how Pochita's dead.

196
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:39,337
{\c&H736C5F&\pos(330,125)}General

197
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:39,335
We haven't had breakfast yet, either. \NLet's grab something at the rest area.

198
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,366
Sorry, but I don't have any cash.

199
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:46,337
Just pick what you want. I'll pay.

200
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,318
And you're conspicuous \Nwithout a shirt on, so wear this.

201
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,348
Here.

202
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:04,282
All my life people have avoided me, \Nsaying I'm filthy and smell bad.

203
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,331
No one's ever been nice to me before.

204
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,315
Much less a girl who looks this good!

205
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,291
I love her!

206
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,275
I'll take some udon...

207
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,232
Udon and... a sausage!

208
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,254
Is that cool?

209
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:26,279
Sure is. I'll take a curry udon, please.

210
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,311
Coming up.

211
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:31,232
Oh, that sounds good, too...

212
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,230
Whoa, there.

213
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,270
Denji? You okay?

214
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,233
You smell good.

215
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,299
How much will it be?

216
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,242
Gimme one sec...

217
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,232
Denji?

218
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,312
It'll be 1,100 yen, all together.

219
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,287
The chainsaws cut me up, too,

220
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,231
Here's 2,000.

221
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,258
so I think I'm a little \Nlow on blood right now.

222
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,231
How did you end up like this?

223
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,315
I had a pet devil, and he replaced my heart.

224
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,262
Kinda hard to believe, huh?

225
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,309
I don't really wanna believe it, either.

226
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,229
Pochita dying for my sake...

227
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,236
There's not a lot of precedent \Nfor your condition,

228
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,264
even from a historical perspective.

229
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,287
It doesn't even have a name.

230
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:22,196
I believe you.

231
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:26,310
I've got a particularly good sense of smell.

232
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,271
So I can tell.

233
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,228
Your best friend is alive inside of you.

234
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,211
Not in the sentimental sense, either.

235
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:39,227
Your body has the scents \Nof both a human and a devil.

236
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,270
Is that right?

237
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,315
That's awesome!

238
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,226
Really... awesome...

239
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,284
Udon?!

240
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,244
The udon?

241
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,235
Is it cool if I eat my udon?

242
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,261
Are you all right? \NCan you eat on your own?

243
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,236
I can...

244
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,261
I can not.

245
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,196
Here. Say, "Ahh."

246
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,208
Ahh...

247
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,277
Is it good?

248
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,286
Woof!

249
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:26,213
You are really sweet to be \Nenjoying soggy udon this much.

250
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,290
A lot like a dog, actually.

251
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,251
Um... what's your name?

252
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,270
Makima.

253
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:41,268
Miss Makima... is there a type\N of guy you l-like?

254
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,289
I'm into the "Denji" type.

255
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,292
Denji?

256
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,286
Dude, that's me.

257
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,217
Is there a type of guy you like?

258
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,258
I'm into the "Denji" type.

259
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,259
I like you, too, Miss Makima.

260
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,261
Denji? This way, come on.

261
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,289
This is the Tokyo headquarters \Nfor our Devil Hunters.

262
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:35,243
There are over a thousand Devil Hunters \Nin Tokyo, including civilians,

263
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:39,281
but Public Safety has the best benefits \Nand a lot of paid vacation time.

264
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,215
If Miss Makima likes me...

265
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:50,255
Then maybe, if we work together, \Nwe'll eventually get together?

266
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:55,317
And if we get together... \Nwe can {\i1}get together{\i0}, right?

267
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:59,282
I wanna! I wanna get together \Nwith her real bad!

268
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,304
Denji...

269
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,218
Yeah?

270
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:08,294
We're supposed to \Nwear uniforms, so put this on.

271
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,290
Once you've changed, \NI'll introduce you to a coworker.

272
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:24,265
This is Aki Hayakawa. He started \Nthree years before you, Denji.

273
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:27,276
You're going to be shadowing him today.

274
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:31,215
I'm not working with you, Miss Makima?

275
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,254
That should be obvious.

276
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,244
You're not even in her league.

277
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,220
Time for patrol.

278
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,235
No! Miss Makima!

279
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,264
Damn it, get up.

280
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:45,300
No way! I wanna work with Miss Makima!

281
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:53,210
If you do a good job, \Nwe can work together someday.

282
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,201
So, do that, okay?

283
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,198
Hey, big man.

284
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,264
Does Miss Makima have a boyfriend?

285
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,265
Hey, come on.

286
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,261
Hey!

287
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,231
Come with me.

288
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,254
You need to quit this job.

289
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,279
Show up tomorrow, \Nand I'll kick your ass again.

290
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,280
Why, though?

291
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,270
Look, I'm trying to be nice, here.

292
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,216
People who start this job without \Nthinking it through end up dead.

293
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:10,228
I've had colleagues who got \Ninto devil hunting for the payday,

294
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,264
and it got them all killed by devils.

295
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:17,248
The survivors are the ones \Nwith real motivation.

296
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:22,269
You're just after Makima, right? \NThat's why you took the job?

297
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,271
Ding-ding!

298
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,270
Then I'm glad I hit you.

299
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:37,304
I'll let her know that you ran off, \Nscared away by the devils.

300
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,274
You really are a nice guy, huh?

301
00:30:56,229 --> 00:31:00,253
Because... when I fight a dude...

302
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:04,214
It's nuts... or nothing!

303
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,304
I had udon for the first time today, man.

304
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,224
A sausage, too.

305
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,244
Got treated like a decent \Nhuman being for the first time,

306
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,277
and even had someone pay for my meal.

307
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,274
It's like a dream come true for me.

308
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:29,237
I didn't really think it through \Nwhen I started devil hunting,

309
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,265
but if I get to keep up this kind of life?

310
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,233
I don't care if it kills me.

311
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,277
Actually, y'know, I take it back.

312
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,277
It's not just {italicize for emphasis}my{/i} life, anymore.

313
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,242
Makima...

314
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:53,209
is not the kind of woman \Na punk like you should be chasing!

315
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,254
What the hell are you saying?

316
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:59,262
Sounds to me like you just like her, too!

317
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:06,254
You... really did...

318
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:11,309
Only aim... for my balls...

319
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,224
Shit.

320
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:24,231
The big guy's testicles were attacked \Nby the Nut Devil, ma'am!

321
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,205
That's a lie. He's lying.

322
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,298
So, do you think you two can work together?

323
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,282
No way!

324
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,252
He's a piece of trash!

325
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,290
I'm glad you two are hitting it off.

326
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:41,254
Denji, you're going to \Nbe joining Hayakawa's unit.

327
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,267
Unit?

328
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,303
This punk?!

329
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:48,221
I've already got enough \Ntroublemakers, don't I?

330
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,238
Adding another... I don't know...

331
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,284
I told you when I put it together, right?

332
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:57,218
Your team's an experimental one, \Noperating differently from the usual method.

333
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,200
What exactly is he, ma'am?

334
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,253
Denji's human, but can \Ntransform into a devil.

335
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,224
Damn right! Pretty sweet, huh?

336
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,220
And that's the truth?

337
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:14,219
I always figured those stories \Nwere baseless rumors.

338
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,253
He's special.

339
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:21,276
Which is why he's going to be \Nreceiving special treatment.

340
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,288
If he tries to resign, \Nor becomes insubordinate...

341
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,296
Denji will be disposed of as a devil.

342
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,270
Uh, what's that mean?

343
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,259
It means we're working \Ntogether until you die.

344
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:44,244
You're going to be living with me \Nso I can keep an eye on you.

345
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,240
Just remember, they said I can \Nkill you if you try to run off.

346
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,216
Hey, is Miss Makima a bad person?

347
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:01,258
If you think that's the case, \Nthen give up on her.

348
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:05,260
If you're really a devil, you should \Njust be grateful she doesn't kill you.

349
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,315
We're Devil Hunters, got that?

350
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,293
So, she's a good person, then?

351
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,224
Of course she is.

352
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,257
She saved my life.

353
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,258
Miss Makima...

354
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,285
I hope I get to hug her again.

355
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,291
Strawberry jam, plum jam, orange jam...

356
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:42,219
Then some butter and honey, plus...

357
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,197
Let's throw some cinnamon on, too.

358
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,274
I got the best toast ever right here!

359
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,316
So good!

360
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,211
It's freaking fantastic!

361
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,258
How long are you gonna be in there?!

362
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,261
Don't fall asleep on the toilet!

363
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,284
A Fiend has been reported \Nin an east Nerima residence.

364
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:28,252
Civilian evacuation and cordon \Nare both complete.

365
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:32,227
The Fiend in question has \Nholed up in a second story room.

366
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,220
We'll leave it to you \NDevil Hunters from here.

367
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,322
Is this a new rookie, Hayakawa?

368
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,273
Hey, what's a Fiend?

369
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:47,273
Did you never go to school or something?

370
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,252
Nah, man, no.

371
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,288
When a devil takes control \Nof a human corpse, you get a Fiend.

372
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,207
Wait, doesn't that make me a Fiend?

373
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,280
No. Fiends always have characteristic heads.

374
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,237
Should be obvious enough once we see him.

375
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:17,304
The devil controls a Fiend's personality.\N You kill this one.

376
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,238
Turn into a devil, \Nand show me what you can do.

377
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,232
That'll help me figure out \Nif you're of any use.

378
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,250
Don't look at me...

379
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:28,217
You're dead! Dead, dead, dead!

380
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,289
Damn Devil Hunters!

381
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:41,298
Hey. Why didn't you use your devil powers?

382
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,213
Thing is...

383
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:48,265
When I kill devils with my powers, \Nthey get real messed up.

384
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:54,314
So, like... I coulda ended up \Nlike this Fiend, right?

385
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:59,262
So I kinda... wanted to \Nmake it painless for him.

386
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,269
All right. Listen to me.

387
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,248
Fiends are just like any other devil.

388
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,276
If you're hunting them, \Nthen drop the sympathy.

389
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:12,200
My entire family was killed \Nby a devil right in front of me.

390
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:15,275
I've had drinks with the cops down below.

391
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:19,254
They're risking their lives \Nto protect their wives and kids.

392
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,261
Everyone is serious about this except you.

393
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,257
I'd rather make any devil I kill \Nsuffer as much as possible.

394
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,314
What are you trying to do? \NMake friends with them?

395
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:35,304
If there's a devil I could be \Nfriends with, then yeah, I would.

396
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,232
'Cuz I don't have any friends.

397
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:45,219
I'll remember that.

398
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,243
Guess I pissed him off...

399
00:37:56,232 --> 00:38:00,196
I was just trying to keep \Nblood off these dirty magazines.

400
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:04,261
When the chainsaws are out, blood gets \Neverywhere and makes a real mess.

401
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:08,240
I made it easy for you, \Nso I get to keep these!

402
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,281
Okay, the porn is secured.

403
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:19,236
I want you to show me your dream.

404
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:22,238
I'm pretty serious about this, Pochita.

405
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:26,235
I'm already living the dream, \Njust like our bargain said.

406
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:29,259
I'll remember that.

407
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:34,301
My dream might've come true already, \Nbut he must be chasing his.

408
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:40,314
I get to bathe every day, eat good food...

409
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:43,258
Get to hang around a hot chick...

410
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:48,245
My life's a 10 outta 10, but it feels \Nlike something's missing.

411
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:52,234
Am I missing something? Something that'd\N give me a real perfect score?

412
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,301
He's gotta be after some revenge shit.

413
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,282
They're trying to protect their families.

414
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,279
I wonder if Miss Makima \Nis after anything like that?

415
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,200
Miss Makima...

416
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,266
I wanna touch her boobs.

417
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:18,252
Touching boobs is a dream I gave\N up on a long time ago,

418
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,302
but I've got a real job now. \NMaybe I could pull it off?

419
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,269
I probably couldn't score \Nwith a girl just yet.

420
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,275
But boobs?

421
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,282
If I had the right plan, and the\N willpower, then maybe...

422
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,278
Everyone is serious about this except you.

423
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:37,236
So that's what he meant!

424
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,293
I've found it! Something to be serious about!

425
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,250
My goal! It's...

426
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,264
Boobs!

427
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,241
Boobs?

428
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:49,233
Hey! Pay attention, dumbass!

429
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,221
Listen to what?

430
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,271
I'm assigning you a partner \Nstarting today, Denji.

431
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,221
Partner?

432
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,237
As a precaution, Public Safety executes patrols

433
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:02,305
and smaller missions with two-person teams.

434
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,196
This is great timing. She's here.

435
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,245
Be careful. She's a Fiend.

436
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:14,266
Prostrate yourselves, humans!

437
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,229
For I am Power!

438
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,255
Are you to be my so-called partner?!

439
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,264
Power?! Your name's Power?!

440
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,233
And you're a Fiend?!

441
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:26,201
Are Fiends allowed to be Devil Hunters?!

442
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:32,198
Well, whatever! Nice to meet you!

443
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:36,247
Fiends, like devils, \Nare targets for extermination.

444
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,315
But Power's highly rational,

445
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,237
so she's been on Hayakawa's team.

446
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,231
I mentioned this before,

447
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,271
but Public Safety Devil Extermination \NSpecial Division 4 is an experimental unit.

448
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:50,260
The higher-ups will be looking \Nto dissolve your team as soon as possible

449
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,250
if you can't get results.

450
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,275
I don't need to explain what would happen \Nto you two if that happens, do I?

451
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,284
Power's horns stand out a bit too much,

452
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,322
so you'll want to patrol areas \Nwithout a lot of pedestrians.

453
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:22,268
Human! Provide me with something \Nto kill immediately!

454
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,292
I am starved for blood!

455
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:31,241
I can put up with crazy, \Nas long as she's hot enough.

456
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,252
The question is, how do I get \Nmy hands on those boobs?

457
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,322
If you run into any civilian Devil Hunters,

458
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:44,214
or the police try to question you \Nabout what you're doing...

459
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,211
We've got a pair of suspicious individuals...

460
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,249
Excuse me, I need to ask you—

461
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,235
We're with Public Safety Devil \NExtermination Special Division 4.

462
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,246
...say that, show them your ID,

463
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,251
and they'll make a sour face \Nand leave you alone.

464
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,267
Where the hell are all the devils?!

465
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:59,272
This is likely my fault!

466
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:03,283
Before becoming a Fiend, \NI was a devil that was feared by all!

467
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,222
Demonic peons will likely flee \Nthe moment they catch my scent!

468
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,221
Wait, how are we gonna \Nget anything done, then?!

469
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,312
If you have any questions, \Njust ask Hayakawa.

470
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,293
He's the one who put you two together.

471
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:21,222
That asshole! He set me up!

472
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,247
He stuck me with Power \Nso I can't do anything cool!

473
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,269
He's trying to get me fired!

474
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,290
The scent of blood!

475
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:36,234
Whoa! Hey, crazy, where you going?!

476
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:42,234
The game is afoot!

477
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,290
The battle is joined!

478
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,322
Damn, she's fast!

479
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:48,287
The scene's evacuated and blocked off.

480
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,261
It's the Sea Cucumber Devil. \NYes, the Sea Cucumber Devil.

481
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:54,241
Requesting backup \Nin front of Nerima Station.

482
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,243
I said, it's the Sea Cucumber—

483
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,222
Do you know what a sea cucumber is?

484
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,278
Look, I'm trying to say—

485
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,258
What the...?

486
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,320
Did you see?! The kill is mine!

487
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,761
If Public Safety kills \Na civilian hunter's devil,

488
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,822
we're guilty of obstructing their business.

489
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,812
Normally, you'd be arrested \Nfor that kind of thing.

490
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:48,798
Power, you're going to need \Nto think a bit more before acting.

491
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,809
And you'll have to get her \Nunder control, Denji.

492
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,813
I'm in trouble, too?

493
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,829
Before becoming a Fiend, \NPower was the Blood Devil...

494
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,829
So she's got a talent \Nfor using blood in battle,

495
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,800
but also gets worked up pretty easily.

496
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,834
Maybe she's not cut out to be \Na Devil Hunter after all.

497
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:07,852
It...

498
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:11,854
I-It was he who commanded me to kill!

499
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:16,776
I did not! How can you just lie like that?!

500
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,829
It is no lie! It was him!

501
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:22,764
The human ordered me to kill \Nthis devil! That's the truth!

502
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,765
What a creep!

503
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,786
Miss Makima, this devil's a total liar!

504
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:28,880
You oughta arrest her right now!

505
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,807
You're under arrest for the crime \Nof being a fake-ass liar!

506
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,834
Not true! It was by his command!

507
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,812
Devils do not lie! It is only humans who do!

508
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,837
No one ever said that!

509
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:43,758
And you're the reason why! \NDumbass! Shitty liar!

510
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,792
Humans and your filthy lies!

511
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,846
I only did as I was told!

512
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:51,818
Why the hell do you talk like \Nthat anyway?! It's so creepy!

513
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,812
Could you quiet down?

514
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,785
Y-Yes.

515
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,828
Very good, Power.

516
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:07,782
Honestly, I don't really care \Nwho got in whose way.

517
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,831
I want to see the two of you \Nworking well together.

518
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,782
Can you show me that?

519
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:15,833
We... W-We can.

520
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,860
Maybe I should worry about \Ncopping a feel some other time.

521
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:07,850
Y'know, being able to just grab a drink \Nlike this is a dream come true to me.

522
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,857
But if we keep screwing up,

523
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,807
being thirsty is probably gonna be \Nthe least of my problems.

524
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:19,812
Not that it'll make it any easier to work \Nwith some chick that lies, though.

525
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,814
I only enjoy the company of cats.

526
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,796
I hate humans.

527
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:31,778
It's not a matter of personal grievance.

528
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,848
My hatred is almost like a demonic instinct.

529
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,770
And I hate devils, too.

530
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,863
Since one of them took \Nmy pet Meowy away.

531
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:46,774
Before I was able to recover Meowy, \NI fell into Makima's clutches.

532
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:50,790
My dear Meowy may be dead already, and yet...\NI find it hard to give up hope.

533
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,747
If it lets me retrieve Meowy \Nfrom that demon,

534
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,830
I'm willing to abide humans, \Nor anything else I needs must.

535
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,849
I doubt you'd understand \Nsuch concern for a cat.

536
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,845
For a cat? That's dumb as hell.

537
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,832
But I'd do whatever it takes \Nto get to fondle some boobs.

538
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,827
It seems I may never understand humans.

539
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,789
But I think I'd get you if it was a dog.

540
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,827
What would you say to the \Nprospect of fondling my chest

541
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,812
after retrieving Meowy from that devil?

542
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:34,830
That {\i1}fucking{\i0} devil...

543
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,837
thinks he can just kidnap some poor cat?!

544
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,821
Well, I don't think so!

545
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,818
As a Devil Hunter, I say no!

546
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:52,788
I'm gonna kill the shit out of that devil!

547
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,825
Leave for the Fiend, Power, is approved.

548
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,839
Make sure to have her back by 5:00 PM.

549
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,858
You're not even allowed to \Ngo out on your own?

550
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:41,801
Indeed. I've had to idly while \Naway my time in here.

551
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,760
I know where the devil \Nthat kidnapped Meowy dwells.

552
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,871
The concern is that you are \Nthe only one who can fight it.

553
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:06,846
He's likely to use Meowy \Nas a shield upon seeing me.

554
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,760
If that happens, then all is lost.

555
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,834
I had a pet devil named Pochita, y'know?

556
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:21,759
I can't pet him anymore, but it's cool.

557
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,772
Because he's alive in here.

558
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,822
How foolish you humans are.

559
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:31,779
Does that not mean Pochita is dead?

560
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:35,783
Death is the absence of life. \NThis nonsense about living on in your heart

561
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,810
is little more than miserable self-comfort.

562
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,831
Uh-huh. I guess so.

563
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,851
I don't think I'm ever \Ngonna get along with her.

564
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:10,847
The American matter has got the Soviet \Nwar hawks crowing more loudly than ever.

565
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:15,786
There are rumors about \Nthe military use of devils, as well.

566
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:20,853
Hopefully, devils will remain \NJapan's only enemies in the future.

567
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:23,749
Makima, how are the hunting dogs

568
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,795
that have been added \Nto the squad performing?

569
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:30,824
There's one that seems promising, \Nand another that seems interesting.

570
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,813
Interesting...?

571
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,826
A pup that I just recently picked up.

572
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:40,808
Your job is to raise these hounds, \Nand then put them to work.

573
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,778
Make sure not to grow attached.

574
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,779
As far as I can tell, \NDenji's disgusting, not "interesting."

575
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,831
Why do you have such high hopes for him?

576
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:25,786
All devils are born with names.

577
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:28,848
And the more those names are feared,

578
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,810
the more powerful the devil \Nis said to become.

579
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:36,812
Coffee isn't considered very frightening,

580
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,857
so a Coffee Devil would probably be weak.

581
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,851
But what about a Car Devil?

582
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:48,799
It's easy to imagine being run over \Nand dying, so it would probably be strong.

583
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:54,786
And Denji can turn into a Chainsaw Devil.

584
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,808
Seems pretty interesting to me.

585
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,824
He might be interesting, \Nbut I'm not sure he'll be any use.

586
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:11,830
Everyone in Public Safety has \Na real goal or motivation.

587
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:15,806
But he said he just wants \Nto live the good life.

588
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,821
He's a bad fit for our operation.

589
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:22,758
Not only that, but he thinks \Nhe can be friends with devils.

590
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:26,805
He's still a kid. A stupid brat.

591
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:41,802
That is the house!

592
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,830
Meowy and the devil are in there.

593
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:49,847
Well, we better get going, then.

594
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,835
Hope I don't have to chainsaw out. \NLosing all that blood's a drag.

595
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,839
Chainsaw?

596
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,795
Yeah. I can turn into a buncha chainsaws.

597
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:09,822
Human jokes leave much to be desired.

598
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,790
What is it now?

599
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:20,789
Isn't he gonna use the cat \Nas a hostage if he sees you?

600
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,798
Should you even, like, be this close?

601
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,853
Oh, I did say that, didn't I?

602
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,796
You {\i1}said{\i0}...?

603
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:31,782
I misspoke.

604
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:50,762
Fool that you are, it seems \Nyour instincts are sharp.

605
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,833
You kept me waiting \Na long time, Blood Devil.

606
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,794
I thought you had run away.

607
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:26,844
Spare me your complaints! \NIt took me this long to gain some freedom.

608
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:31,800
And I've brought a human \Njust as you demanded, Bat!

609
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,840
My first meal in ages...

610
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:42,827
A young man? I'm sure his \Nblood will be full of vigor.

611
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:52,777
Look at my arm, human.

612
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,766
The wound that your kind gave me!

613
00:55:55,769 --> 00:56:00,816
The damnable wound \Nthat forced me into hiding!

614
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,781
Like I give a shit. Dumbass.

615
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,813
Food shouldn't speak!

616
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:11,814
Time to heal the wounds humans \Ngave me with human blood!

617
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,793
Disgusting!

618
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:27,823
I've been revived with awful-tasting blood!

619
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,794
The inside of my mouth tastes disgusting...

620
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:38,770
I need to cleanse my palate \Nwith another human now!

621
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:49,771
What are you trying to do? \NMake friends with them?

622
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:58,778
I'm amazed you actually believed my story.

623
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:03,863
Humans truly are foolish.

624
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,854
The stench of cigarettes...

625
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,752
The scent of makeup and drugs...

626
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:17,848
Are you serious?

627
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:18,857
Wow!

628
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:23,788
There's a decent aroma.

629
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,823
I'll cleanse my palate with some children.

630
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:28,855
Bat Devil!

631
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,787
I brought you a human, as promised!

632
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,815
Release Meowy.

633
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:42,803
Oh, I did say I'd do that, didn't I?

634
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:47,796
Meowy!

635
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:52,847
But I hadn't punished you for bringing me \Nsuch nasty blood yet, had I?

636
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:58,830
Meowy...?

637
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,787
Meowy!

638
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,810
Your name shall be Meowy!

639
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,812
You smell tasty, for a cat.

640
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,791
So spindly, though.

641
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,828
Let's put some meat \Non those bones before I feast.

642
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,830
Grow big and strong, now.

643
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,797
I'm looking forward to killing you, Meowy.

644
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:45,821
I've killed all who've met my eyes.

645
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:51,776
It's become strange to hear a voice \Nthat isn't screaming.

646
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,756
So strange...

647
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:02,828
Blood Devil...

648
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,790
I need blood.

649
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:13,825
If you want to save this cat, \Nthen bring me a human.

650
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:34,780
You said you couldn't pet \NPochita anymore, yes?

651
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:38,780
I understand how you feel now.

652
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,794
'Tis an awful feeling.

653
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,789
Nasty!

654
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:53,809
All of this repulsive blood!

655
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:01,774
The inside of my mouth feels filthy!

656
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,752
I need to gargle with the blood of children!

657
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:13,777
After I gargle, a virgin \Nshould make a fine appetizer.

658
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,835
Then a beefy man for a main course...

659
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:19,790
And a pregnant woman for dessert.

660
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,771
Gimme my tits back!

661
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:30,789
You're drinking my blood?! \NThat's disgusting!

662
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:33,856
I don't even feel like drinking your blood!

663
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,790
There was a time I couldn't find Pochita.

664
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:42,794
He was gone when I woke up in the morning...

665
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:45,785
So I looked all over town, \Nbut couldn't find him.

666
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:49,819
I thought a devil might've eaten him,

667
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:55,772
but when I got home, \Nhe was crying, waiting for me.

668
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,818
I remember being so relieved, \NI fell asleep holding him.

669
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:08,789
I wonder how she felt when she tried to sleep,\Nknowing that devil had Meowy.

670
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,817
You're a devil?!

671
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,839
Hey, dumbass! You wanna get eaten?!

672
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,852
You let her escape?

673
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:01,766
You're a devil! \NWhat do you think you're doing?!

674
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,768
Think I'm gonna split open your guts...

675
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,827
And then cop me a feel!

676
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:50,864
Get out of here already!

677
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:04,765
If you're so set on saving humans...

678
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,846
Can you cut through this?!

679
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:14,836
The chainsaws retract?!

680
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:17,775
Such brute strength in that tiny body!

681
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,813
Why would you use that power \Nto save a human?!

682
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:24,834
You think I saved him?

683
01:03:25,801 --> 01:03:26,822
{\b1\fs30\fnVerdana\fscy125}Western Tokyo

684
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:29,821
I don't give a shit...

685
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,773
about saving some {\i1}dude{\i0}!

686
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,816
I need to heal now.

687
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,825
Your blood reeks of cigarettes, \Nbut it should do, for now.

688
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:15,764
How are you still alive?!

689
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:20,868
Through all of this crap...

690
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:24,836
I've been about as patient as possible.

691
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:30,797
So how come I haven't...

692
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:35,839
gotten to cop a single damn feel yet?!

693
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,836
S-Stay away!
