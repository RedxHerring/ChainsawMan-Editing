1
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:54,071
Better head to work.

2
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,012
It's about 60,000 a month \Nfor cutting down trees, right?

3
00:01:20,088 --> 00:01:25,025
Then there's the kidney I sold. \NThat was 1.2 million.

4
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:29,048
My right eye was 300,000.

5
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:32,037
Sold one of my nuts...

6
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:37,022
How much was that, again? \NI think... not even 100,000.

7
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:42,087
And I still owe...

8
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,087
About 38,040,000 yen.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,005
I heard you, Pochita.

10
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:54,085
Let's kill this thing already.

11
00:01:55,088 --> 00:02:00,072
A dead devil's usually good \Nfor about 300,000...

12
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:07,042
Devil hunting pays the best, easy.

13
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:54,095
Gotta be the Tomato Devil.

14
00:03:55,062 --> 00:03:58,035
He'll revive from the seeds, \Nso you'll wanna burn those.

15
00:03:58,076 --> 00:04:01,000
Nice work, Denji.

16
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,045
This carcass will bring in a fair \Nprice on the black market.

17
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,041
I'll pay you 400,000.

18
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,035
Hey, thanks!

19
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:11,059
After what you owe and \Nthe interest, that leaves 170,000.

20
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:14,071
So after the finder's fee, admin fee,

21
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:19,015
management costs, and so on...

22
00:04:19,077 --> 00:04:21,065
Leaves me with 70,000.

23
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:28,046
After the water bill, \Nand some other stuff I owe...

24
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,091
Funny how that works.

25
00:04:31,048 --> 00:04:34,041
I've got 1,800 yen left.

26
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:40,060
No food at home, and this is gonna \Nhave to last us a month, so...

27
00:04:41,044 --> 00:04:45,016
Pochita, looks like dinner's \Ngonna be a slice of bread.

28
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:55,006
Why hire a brat like that to hunt devils?

29
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:59,013
He's paying off what he owes us.

30
00:04:59,013 --> 00:05:02,094
Well, technically, it was \Nhis deadbeat old man's debt.

31
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:07,032
And a kid with a pet devil \Ncan get the job done?

32
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,048
The thing about real devil hunters is...

33
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:14,083
They don't pass devil \Ncarcasses onto the yakuza.

34
00:05:15,027 --> 00:05:19,033
Besides, the best thing about Denji \Nis he does what he's told.

35
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:26,020
Hey, dog!

36
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:29,097
I'll give you 100 yen to eat this cigarette.

37
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,022
For real?

38
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:35,069
Don't mind if I do.

39
00:05:41,085 --> 00:05:44,034
We'll be in touch \Nwhen there's another devil.

40
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:46,086
Try and run, and you're pig slop.

41
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,098
That'll keep us for another three days.

42
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,051
The other day I heard...

43
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:14,019
That normally, people put jam \Non their bread, before eating it.

44
00:06:14,094 --> 00:06:18,061
Normal's just a dream for us, though.

45
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:22,077
Doubt I'll pay off this debt before I die.

46
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,093
Probably gonna die without \Never having a girlfriend, too.

47
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:33,087
Not like I could invite a girl to this dump.

48
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:35,091
No money to go on dates, either.

49
00:06:40,085 --> 00:06:43,004
If I could have one dream come true...

50
00:06:43,004 --> 00:06:45,072
I wanna score with a girl before I die.

51
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:05,040
Bastard hung himself {\i1}without{\i0} \Npaying this month's installment first.

52
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:09,060
Boy, you've got until tomorrow \Nto put 700,000 together.

53
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,040
You can beg for it, whore yourself out...\N I don't care. Get it done.

54
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:16,045
Otherwise, we chop you up and sell the bits.

55
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:32,042
A ch-chainsaw...?

56
00:07:37,001 --> 00:07:38,026
A devil.

57
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:44,001
If you're gonna kill me, just do it. \NI'm dead either way.

58
00:07:52,084 --> 00:07:54,011
It's hurt?

59
00:07:55,056 --> 00:07:57,030
You're gonna die, too?

60
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,004
Bite me!

61
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:08,092
I heard that drinking blood heals a devil.

62
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:10,099
If you don't wanna die, bite me!

63
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,094
My blood's not free, though. This is a deal!

64
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:30,019
I'll help you...

65
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,020
So, you help me.

66
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:38,033
Because I don't wanna die, after all.

67
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:55,067
Why don't you hire me as a devil hunter?

68
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:05,047
Too hungry to sleep.

69
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,006
When I can't sleep, \NI start thinking about money,

70
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,077
and then it's even harder to sleep.

71
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:15,086
I know what dream I wanna have when I sleep.

72
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:19,096
Gonna put jam on my bread, \Nand share it with you.

73
00:09:19,096 --> 00:09:22,048
Then I'm gonna flirt with a girl...

74
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:26,024
I'll play video games with her, and then \Nwe'll fall asleep hugging each other.

75
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:28,050
Sounds sweet, right?

76
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:49,097
Y'know, I heard my mom died from some \Nheart disease that made her cough up blood.

77
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:56,094
Got a devil for you, Denji. Time for work.

78
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:19,035
Wish they'd at least let me dream...

79
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:47,074
There's a devil in here, huh?

80
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:54,025
I don't see anything.

81
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:56,053
You think it's hiding?

82
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:00,061
Or maybe it left already?

83
00:11:12,023 --> 00:11:17,052
Denji, my boy... we're pretty \Ngrateful to you, y'know?

84
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:19,055
Yeah?

85
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:22,010
You're as loyal as a dog,

86
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,069
and you work for cheap like one, too.

87
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:30,091
Only problem with dogs \Nis I can't stand the stench.

88
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:50,043
Even yakuza think about getting bigger \Nand making more money, kid.

89
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:54,074
So we did like you, \Nand made a deal with a devil.

90
00:11:57,033 --> 00:12:01,003
We wanted demonic power...

91
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:04,096
And I want devil hunters...

92
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:06,054
Dead!

93
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:13,003
Y'know, little devil hunter, \Nthese guys are dumb as hell.

94
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:14,061
Total suckers!

95
00:12:14,061 --> 00:12:21,021
I offer them a bit of demonic power, \Nand they offer to become my slaves...

96
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:24,058
Even though the power \Nturns them into zombies.

97
00:12:24,058 --> 00:12:27,022
See, because I'm the Zombie Devil.

98
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:31,097
And I hate devil hunters, because you\N go around killing us devils.

99
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:34,049
So I'm gonna kill you.

100
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:41,007
Boys, tear him apart \Nand toss him in the trash.

101
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:43,023
Shit!

102
00:12:58,094 --> 00:13:00,013
How do I get out of here?

103
00:13:16,097 --> 00:13:18,010
Get off!

104
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:33,053
It's not like I'm asking to be rich.

105
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:38,013
All I want is a normal life!

106
00:13:39,057 --> 00:13:42,059
And I can't even have that?!

107
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:24,008
Pochita...

108
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:25,060
Pochita!

109
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:29,026
Pochita, time for work.

110
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:46,090
Pochita, there's a good chance \NI'm gonna die fighting a devil.

111
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:50,061
My only regret would be \Nleaving you on your own.

112
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:54,017
You could end up starving to death...

113
00:14:54,056 --> 00:14:57,056
Or some other devil hunter might kill you.

114
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:06,030
I've heard some devils \Ncan take over dead bodies.

115
00:15:07,001 --> 00:15:12,058
If that's something you can do... \Nthen I want you to have my body.

116
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:18,006
The yakuza won't be on your case \Nif you wait until I've been buried, right?

117
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:23,000
And then you could move \Nout of here... and then...

118
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,006
Yeah.

119
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:29,084
I want you to live a normal life, \Nand die a normal death.

120
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:36,020
You've gotta make my dream come true.

121
00:16:04,018 --> 00:16:05,028
Pochita?

122
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,003
Did you take my body, like I said?

123
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:17,078
I always loved hearing you talk \Nabout your dreams, Denji.

124
00:16:19,096 --> 00:16:23,092
Here's the deal. I'll give you my heart...

125
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:28,079
And in exchange, I want you \Nto show me your dream.

126
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,067
Pochita?!

127
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,064
I'm not hurt?

128
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:45,081
Pochita...?

129
00:16:53,063 --> 00:16:55,050
What is this?

130
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,077
You're alive after being sliced up?

131
00:16:57,077 --> 00:16:59,058
Why? Gross!

132
00:16:59,058 --> 00:17:02,058
I seriously hate devil hunters.

133
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:05,086
Guys, go ahead and eat him.

134
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:17,009
These guys had plenty already, \Nso why'd they want even more?

135
00:17:18,012 --> 00:17:19,060
Am I the same?

136
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:23,060
I wasn't satisfied with \Nthe happiness I had with Pochita.

137
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:26,093
I kept dreaming about a better life.

138
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:31,061
I guess we all dream \Nabout stuff like that, huh?

139
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:34,074
I can't blame you, then.

140
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:38,036
And I won't, but...

141
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:42,087
If you get in our way?

142
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,093
You'll die!

143
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:58,088
He's bound to stay dead after being eaten.

144
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:32,079
What are you?!

145
00:18:33,018 --> 00:18:36,080
Did that devil runt take your body?!

146
00:18:37,063 --> 00:18:39,047
That means you're one of us!

147
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:01,089
Ow...

148
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:16,063
It hurts!

149
00:19:18,027 --> 00:19:20,040
Stay away!

150
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,043
Move!

151
00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:29,043
Stay back! Back! Get away!

152
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,094
Stay away! Don't do it!

153
00:19:31,094 --> 00:19:33,094
Don't come near me!

154
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,089
Die!

155
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:31,008
I guess you guys went full devil, huh?

156
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,029
Well, you hired me to be a devil hunter.

157
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:39,055
So, I better kill all the devils, right?!

158
00:20:44,098 --> 00:20:46,009
Oh, yeah!

159
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:49,047
Once you're all dead...

160
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,074
I won't owe a damn thing!

161
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:40,044
Someone got here before us.

162
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:51,005
There's still one alive.

163
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:09,025
You've got a strange smell.

164
00:22:10,002 --> 00:22:12,060
Not like a human or a devil.

165
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:17,068
I take it you did this?

166
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,011
H-Hug me...

167
00:22:43,048 --> 00:22:44,067
He's human.

168
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:47,042
Any chance he's possessed?

169
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:49,012
No.

170
00:22:49,012 --> 00:22:51,040
I can tell who's possessed \Nwith a look at their face.

171
00:22:53,096 --> 00:22:57,005
I came here to kill the Zombie Devil.

172
00:22:57,005 --> 00:22:59,030
I'm a devil hunter with Public Safety.

173
00:23:03,072 --> 00:23:05,099
You have two options:

174
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:09,080
I can kill you like a devil,

175
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:13,029
or I can keep you as a human.

176
00:23:13,095 --> 00:23:17,020
If I keep you, I'll make sure you're fed.

177
00:23:26,008 --> 00:23:27,059
When you say that...

178
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:30,072
Like, what's for breakfast?

179
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:38,010
Bread with butter and jam, salad, coffee...

180
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:42,023
And then maybe something \Nfor dessert, I think?

181
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,058
That sounds awesome.

182
00:24:09,077 --> 00:24:13,008
My view cracks as I see the rat race rush by

183
00:24:13,008 --> 00:24:16,041
Flat on the ground looking up, \Nno matter how it makes me feel

184
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:19,056
The beat pounds in time, no clapping needed

185
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:23,069
So mad I wanna forget, \Nwith my chain spinning

186
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:30,089
The roar of my engine \Nis enough to drown it all out

187
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:32,059
And with a click of the tongue

188
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:34,010
Everything goes black with dried

189
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,090
CHAINSAW BLOOD

190
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,017
My blood can seethe or rage

191
00:24:38,017 --> 00:24:39,015
But I just can't quit

192
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:42,009
No matter how I get smashed up, \Nthere's no stopping now

193
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:45,023
Whoo Whoo Whoo Whoo

194
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:46,094
Tell me why you cry?

195
00:24:46,094 --> 00:24:47,094
Tell me why...?

196
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:49,006
CHAINSAW BLOOD

197
00:24:49,006 --> 00:24:51,023
My blood can seethe or rage

198
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:52,026
But I just can't quit

199
00:24:52,026 --> 00:24:54,045
Every blood of drop that \Ngoes down is a nightmare

200
00:24:54,045 --> 00:24:55,018
Reborn

201
00:24:55,018 --> 00:24:58,038
Whoo Whoo Whoo Whoo

202
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,002
Tell me why you cry?

203
00:25:00,002 --> 00:25:00,095
Tell me why…?

204
00:25:00,095 --> 00:25:02,015
CHAINSAW BLOOD

205
00:25:02,015 --> 00:25:04,033
The blood can seethe or rage

206
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:05,032
But I just can't quit

207
00:25:05,032 --> 00:25:07,050
Every blood of drop that \Ngoes down is a nightmare

208
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,024
Reborn

209
00:25:08,024 --> 00:25:11,041
Whoo Whoo Whoo Whoo

210
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:13,006
Tell me why you cry...?

211
00:25:13,006 --> 00:25:15,053
Tell me why... are you grinning?

212
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:37,164
That was my stomach.

213
00:25:39,096 --> 00:25:41,114
What's your name?

214
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,122
It's Denji!

215
00:25:43,122 --> 00:25:45,119
I need to tell you something right now.

216
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:50,140
From now on, you're in my care, Denji.

217
00:25:51,094 --> 00:25:55,131
I expect "yes" or "woof" for answers. \NI don't need a dog that says "no."

218
00:25:56,157 --> 00:25:58,110
When you say that...

219
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,091
Someone in forensics once told me...

220
00:26:01,132 --> 00:26:06,067
That when we get dogs that \Naren't helpful, we put them down.

221
00:26:11,097 --> 00:26:13,126
I thought she was nice.

222
00:26:13,162 --> 00:26:16,085
I kind of liked her.

223
00:26:16,085 --> 00:26:19,074
I had no idea she was scary like this.

224
00:26:19,074 --> 00:26:21,151
Treating me like a damn dog...

225
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,094
I just remembered how Pochita's dead.

226
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:39,128
{\c&H736C5F&\pos(330,125)}General

227
00:26:34,122 --> 00:26:39,128
We haven't had breakfast yet, either. \NLet's grab something at the rest area.

228
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:42,154
Sorry, but I don't have any cash.

229
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:46,124
Just pick what you want. I'll pay.

230
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,123
And you're conspicuous \Nwithout a shirt on, so wear this.

231
00:26:53,138 --> 00:26:54,138
Here.

232
00:27:00,094 --> 00:27:04,104
All my life people have avoided me, \Nsaying I'm filthy and smell bad.

233
00:27:04,104 --> 00:27:06,118
No one's ever been nice to me before.

234
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:09,115
Much less a girl who looks this good!

235
00:27:12,157 --> 00:27:14,081
I love her!

236
00:28:48,137 --> 00:28:50,123
I'll take some udon...

237
00:28:50,123 --> 00:28:53,106
Udon and... a sausage!

238
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,108
Is that cool?

239
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:57,134
Sure is. I'll take a curry udon, please.

240
00:28:57,134 --> 00:28:58,147
Coming up.

241
00:28:58,147 --> 00:29:02,080
Oh, that sounds good, too...

242
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,091
Whoa, there.

243
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,128
Denji? You okay?

244
00:29:07,135 --> 00:29:09,102
You smell good.

245
00:29:09,102 --> 00:29:10,133
How much will it be?

246
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:12,106
Gimme one sec...

247
00:29:11,102 --> 00:29:12,106
Denji?

248
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:14,163
It'll be 1,100 yen, all together.

249
00:29:14,163 --> 00:29:17,135
The chainsaws cut me up, too,

250
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:19,090
Here's 2,000.

251
00:29:18,065 --> 00:29:20,129
so I think I'm a little \Nlow on blood right now.

252
00:29:21,131 --> 00:29:24,082
How did you end up like this?

253
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:27,158
I had a pet devil, and he replaced my heart.

254
00:29:28,158 --> 00:29:30,133
Kinda hard to believe, huh?

255
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:32,153
I don't really wanna believe it, either.

256
00:29:33,097 --> 00:29:36,076
Pochita dying for my sake...

257
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:43,105
There's not a lot of precedent \Nfor your condition,

258
00:29:43,105 --> 00:29:45,109
even from a historical perspective.

259
00:29:46,072 --> 00:29:48,137
It doesn't even have a name.

260
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:53,065
I believe you.

261
00:29:54,164 --> 00:29:57,161
I've got a particularly good sense of smell.

262
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,133
So I can tell.

263
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,069
Your best friend is alive inside of you.

264
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:06,082
Not in the sentimental sense, either.

265
00:30:06,113 --> 00:30:10,098
Your body has the scents \Nof both a human and a devil.

266
00:30:11,104 --> 00:30:12,127
Is that right?

267
00:30:12,127 --> 00:30:13,153
That's awesome!

268
00:30:13,153 --> 00:30:16,089
Really... awesome...

269
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:24,146
Udon?!

270
00:30:26,122 --> 00:30:27,104
The udon?

271
00:30:33,147 --> 00:30:36,072
Is it cool if I eat my udon?

272
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,098
Are you all right? \NCan you eat on your own?

273
00:30:40,098 --> 00:30:41,100
I can...

274
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:44,112
I can not.

275
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:47,065
Here. Say, "Ahh."

276
00:30:47,065 --> 00:30:48,074
Ahh...

277
00:30:49,157 --> 00:30:50,149
Is it good?

278
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:51,149
Woof!

279
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:57,075
You are really sweet to be \Nenjoying soggy udon this much.

280
00:30:57,075 --> 00:30:58,156
A lot like a dog, actually.

281
00:31:02,095 --> 00:31:05,090
Um... what's your name?

282
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:07,126
Makima.

283
00:31:07,161 --> 00:31:12,126
Miss Makima... is there a type\N of guy you l-like?

284
00:31:19,123 --> 00:31:21,139
I'm into the "Denji" type.

285
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:23,163
Denji?

286
00:31:27,124 --> 00:31:28,129
Dude, that's me.

287
00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:40,090
Is there a type of guy you like?

288
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,096
I'm into the "Denji" type.

289
00:31:44,106 --> 00:31:47,109
I like you, too, Miss Makima.

290
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,112
Denji? This way, come on.

291
00:31:53,153 --> 00:31:56,135
This is the Tokyo headquarters \Nfor our Devil Hunters.

292
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:06,097
There are over a thousand Devil Hunters \Nin Tokyo, including civilians,

293
00:32:06,097 --> 00:32:10,142
but Public Safety has the best benefits \Nand a lot of paid vacation time.

294
00:32:14,075 --> 00:32:17,087
If Miss Makima likes me...

295
00:32:17,121 --> 00:32:21,129
Then maybe, if we work together, \Nwe'll eventually get together?

296
00:32:22,137 --> 00:32:26,160
And if we get together... \Nwe can {\i1}get together{\i0}, right?

297
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:30,138
I wanna! I wanna get together \Nwith her real bad!

298
00:32:33,123 --> 00:32:34,164
Denji...

299
00:32:35,095 --> 00:32:36,089
Yeah?

300
00:32:36,153 --> 00:32:39,139
We're supposed to \Nwear uniforms, so put this on.

301
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,141
Once you've changed, \NI'll introduce you to a coworker.

302
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:55,120
This is Aki Hayakawa. He started \Nthree years before you, Denji.

303
00:32:55,164 --> 00:32:58,113
You're going to be shadowing him today.

304
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:02,088
I'm not working with you, Miss Makima?

305
00:33:02,134 --> 00:33:04,096
That should be obvious.

306
00:33:04,096 --> 00:33:07,087
You're not even in her league.

307
00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:08,093
Time for patrol.

308
00:33:08,093 --> 00:33:11,071
No! Miss Makima!

309
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,113
Damn it, get up.

310
00:33:13,113 --> 00:33:16,151
No way! I wanna work with Miss Makima!

311
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:24,075
If you do a good job, \Nwe can work together someday.

312
00:33:33,071 --> 00:33:35,074
So, do that, okay?

313
00:33:42,123 --> 00:33:44,072
Hey, big man.

314
00:33:45,071 --> 00:33:47,125
Does Miss Makima have a boyfriend?

315
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,102
Hey, come on.

316
00:33:54,105 --> 00:33:55,105
Hey!

317
00:33:55,162 --> 00:33:57,089
Come with me.

318
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:24,125
You need to quit this job.

319
00:34:25,123 --> 00:34:27,152
Show up tomorrow, \Nand I'll kick your ass again.

320
00:34:28,123 --> 00:34:29,150
Why, though?

321
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:33,126
Look, I'm trying to be nice, here.

322
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:37,081
People who start this job without \Nthinking it through end up dead.

323
00:34:37,081 --> 00:34:41,088
I've had colleagues who got \Ninto devil hunting for the payday,

324
00:34:41,088 --> 00:34:43,127
and it got them all killed by devils.

325
00:34:44,074 --> 00:34:48,094
The survivors are the ones \Nwith real motivation.

326
00:34:49,103 --> 00:34:53,139
You're just after Makima, right? \NThat's why you took the job?

327
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,132
Ding-ding!

328
00:34:56,114 --> 00:34:58,144
Then I'm glad I hit you.

329
00:35:03,104 --> 00:35:08,161
I'll let her know that you ran off, \Nscared away by the devils.

330
00:35:23,115 --> 00:35:26,122
You really are a nice guy, huh?

331
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:31,127
Because... when I fight a dude...

332
00:35:31,127 --> 00:35:35,066
It's nuts... or nothing!

333
00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:44,146
I had udon for the first time today, man.

334
00:35:45,122 --> 00:35:47,099
A sausage, too.

335
00:35:47,141 --> 00:35:50,094
Got treated like a decent \Nhuman being for the first time,

336
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:52,119
and even had someone pay for my meal.

337
00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:55,147
It's like a dream come true for me.

338
00:35:56,133 --> 00:36:00,112
I didn't really think it through \Nwhen I started devil hunting,

339
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:03,125
but if I get to keep up this kind of life?

340
00:36:04,106 --> 00:36:06,073
I don't care if it kills me.

341
00:36:07,134 --> 00:36:09,142
Actually, y'know, I take it back.

342
00:36:10,114 --> 00:36:12,119
It's not just {italicize for emphasis}my{/i} life, anymore.

343
00:36:17,136 --> 00:36:19,099
Makima...

344
00:36:20,066 --> 00:36:24,077
is not the kind of woman \Na punk like you should be chasing!

345
00:36:24,114 --> 00:36:26,124
What the hell are you saying?

346
00:36:26,124 --> 00:36:30,098
Sounds to me like you just like her, too!

347
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:37,091
You... really did...

348
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:42,147
Only aim... for my balls...

349
00:36:48,093 --> 00:36:49,091
Shit.

350
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:55,102
The big guy's testicles were attacked \Nby the Nut Devil, ma'am!

351
00:36:56,066 --> 00:36:59,078
That's a lie. He's lying.

352
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:02,149
So, do you think you two can work together?

353
00:37:03,124 --> 00:37:04,123
No way!

354
00:37:04,123 --> 00:37:06,091
He's a piece of trash!

355
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,137
I'm glad you two are hitting it off.

356
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:12,116
Denji, you're going to \Nbe joining Hayakawa's unit.

357
00:37:12,116 --> 00:37:13,133
Unit?

358
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:15,143
This punk?!

359
00:37:15,143 --> 00:37:19,069
I've already got enough \Ntroublemakers, don't I?

360
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:21,091
Adding another... I don't know...

361
00:37:21,091 --> 00:37:23,157
I told you when I put it together, right?

362
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:28,072
Your team's an experimental one, \Noperating differently from the usual method.

363
00:37:30,136 --> 00:37:33,068
What exactly is he, ma'am?

364
00:37:33,068 --> 00:37:37,091
Denji's human, but can \Ntransform into a devil.

365
00:37:37,091 --> 00:37:39,081
Damn right! Pretty sweet, huh?

366
00:37:39,081 --> 00:37:41,065
And that's the truth?

367
00:37:41,065 --> 00:37:45,088
I always figured those stories \Nwere baseless rumors.

368
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,099
He's special.

369
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:52,112
Which is why he's going to be \Nreceiving special treatment.

370
00:37:52,158 --> 00:37:56,156
If he tries to resign, \Nor becomes insubordinate...

371
00:37:56,156 --> 00:37:59,158
Denji will be disposed of as a devil.

372
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,123
Uh, what's that mean?

373
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:08,106
It means we're working \Ntogether until you die.

374
00:38:12,093 --> 00:38:15,110
You're going to be living with me \Nso I can keep an eye on you.

375
00:38:16,091 --> 00:38:19,100
Just remember, they said I can \Nkill you if you try to run off.

376
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,087
Hey, is Miss Makima a bad person?

377
00:38:29,127 --> 00:38:32,099
If you think that's the case, \Nthen give up on her.

378
00:38:32,129 --> 00:38:36,100
If you're really a devil, you should \Njust be grateful she doesn't kill you.

379
00:38:36,137 --> 00:38:38,159
We're Devil Hunters, got that?

380
00:38:39,131 --> 00:38:41,128
So, she's a good person, then?

381
00:38:41,128 --> 00:38:43,096
Of course she is.

382
00:38:44,145 --> 00:38:47,101
She saved my life.

383
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,112
Miss Makima...

384
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:01,122
I hope I get to hug her again.

385
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:09,141
Strawberry jam, plum jam, orange jam...

386
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:13,076
Then some butter and honey, plus...

387
00:39:13,076 --> 00:39:15,068
Let's throw some cinnamon on, too.

388
00:39:15,116 --> 00:39:18,142
I got the best toast ever right here!

389
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,154
So good!

390
00:39:24,085 --> 00:39:26,080
It's freaking fantastic!

391
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:37,098
How long are you gonna be in there?!

392
00:39:39,154 --> 00:39:41,101
Don't fall asleep on the toilet!

393
00:39:51,162 --> 00:39:54,120
A Fiend has been reported \Nin an east Nerima residence.

394
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:59,096
Civilian evacuation and cordon \Nare both complete.

395
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:03,084
The Fiend in question has \Nholed up in a second story room.

396
00:40:03,084 --> 00:40:05,091
We'll leave it to you \NDevil Hunters from here.

397
00:40:05,091 --> 00:40:07,156
Is this a new rookie, Hayakawa?

398
00:40:12,138 --> 00:40:14,147
Hey, what's a Fiend?

399
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:18,113
Did you never go to school or something?

400
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,095
Nah, man, no.

401
00:40:22,101 --> 00:40:25,157
When a devil takes control \Nof a human corpse, you get a Fiend.

402
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:31,068
Wait, doesn't that make me a Fiend?

403
00:40:31,068 --> 00:40:34,149
No. Fiends always have characteristic heads.

404
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:37,100
Should be obvious enough once we see him.

405
00:40:44,096 --> 00:40:48,146
The devil controls a Fiend's personality.\N You kill this one.

406
00:40:49,088 --> 00:40:51,109
Turn into a devil, \Nand show me what you can do.

407
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:54,080
That'll help me figure out \Nif you're of any use.

408
00:40:54,141 --> 00:40:56,085
Don't look at me...

409
00:40:56,085 --> 00:40:59,078
You're dead! Dead, dead, dead!

410
00:40:59,078 --> 00:41:01,140
Damn Devil Hunters!

411
00:41:09,096 --> 00:41:12,157
Hey. Why didn't you use your devil powers?

412
00:41:12,157 --> 00:41:14,088
Thing is...

413
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:19,133
When I kill devils with my powers, \Nthey get real messed up.

414
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:25,158
So, like... I coulda ended up \Nlike this Fiend, right?

415
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:30,096
So I kinda... wanted to \Nmake it painless for him.

416
00:41:31,147 --> 00:41:33,115
All right. Listen to me.

417
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:36,094
Fiends are just like any other devil.

418
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:38,147
If you're hunting them, \Nthen drop the sympathy.

419
00:41:39,098 --> 00:41:43,073
My entire family was killed \Nby a devil right in front of me.

420
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:46,143
I've had drinks with the cops down below.

421
00:41:46,143 --> 00:41:50,123
They're risking their lives \Nto protect their wives and kids.

422
00:41:51,088 --> 00:41:53,112
Everyone is serious about this except you.

423
00:41:54,066 --> 00:41:57,124
I'd rather make any devil I kill \Nsuffer as much as possible.

424
00:41:58,081 --> 00:42:01,150
What are you trying to do? \NMake friends with them?

425
00:42:03,133 --> 00:42:06,146
If there's a devil I could be \Nfriends with, then yeah, I would.

426
00:42:07,122 --> 00:42:09,100
'Cuz I don't have any friends.

427
00:42:13,133 --> 00:42:16,092
I'll remember that.

428
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:27,102
Guess I pissed him off...

429
00:42:27,102 --> 00:42:31,066
I was just trying to keep \Nblood off these dirty magazines.

430
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,103
When the chainsaws are out, blood gets \Neverywhere and makes a real mess.

431
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:39,096
I made it easy for you, \Nso I get to keep these!

432
00:42:44,122 --> 00:42:46,154
Okay, the porn is secured.

433
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,084
I want you to show me your dream.

434
00:42:50,084 --> 00:42:53,109
I'm pretty serious about this, Pochita.

435
00:42:53,148 --> 00:42:57,084
I'm already living the dream, \Njust like our bargain said.

436
00:42:57,143 --> 00:43:00,099
I'll remember that.

437
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:05,135
My dream might've come true already, \Nbut he must be chasing his.

438
00:43:08,075 --> 00:43:11,158
I get to bathe every day, eat good food...

439
00:43:11,158 --> 00:43:14,098
Get to hang around a hot chick...

440
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:19,106
My life's a 10 outta 10, but it feels \Nlike something's missing.

441
00:43:19,149 --> 00:43:23,099
Am I missing something? Something that'd\N give me a real perfect score?

442
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:25,154
He's gotta be after some revenge shit.

443
00:43:26,092 --> 00:43:28,125
They're trying to protect their families.

444
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,125
I wonder if Miss Makima \Nis after anything like that?

445
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:36,068
Miss Makima...

446
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,126
I wanna touch her boobs.

447
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:49,124
Touching boobs is a dream I gave\N up on a long time ago,

448
00:43:49,124 --> 00:43:52,154
but I've got a real job now. \NMaybe I could pull it off?

449
00:43:53,115 --> 00:43:56,108
I probably couldn't score \Nwith a girl just yet.

450
00:43:57,078 --> 00:43:58,115
But boobs?

451
00:43:59,111 --> 00:44:02,153
If I had the right plan, and the\N willpower, then maybe...

452
00:44:03,091 --> 00:44:05,125
Everyone is serious about this except you.

453
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:08,073
So that's what he meant!

454
00:44:08,073 --> 00:44:10,158
I've found it! Something to be serious about!

455
00:44:11,086 --> 00:44:14,084
My goal! It's...

456
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,134
Boobs!

457
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:17,096
Boobs?

458
00:44:17,096 --> 00:44:20,071
Hey! Pay attention, dumbass!

459
00:44:20,071 --> 00:44:21,072
Listen to what?

460
00:44:21,072 --> 00:44:24,122
I'm assigning you a partner \Nstarting today, Denji.

461
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,074
Partner?

462
00:44:26,074 --> 00:44:29,085
As a precaution, Public Safety executes patrols

463
00:44:29,085 --> 00:44:33,161
and smaller missions with two-person teams.

464
00:44:34,106 --> 00:44:37,068
This is great timing. She's here.

465
00:44:37,161 --> 00:44:41,086
Be careful. She's a Fiend.

466
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:45,102
Prostrate yourselves, humans!

467
00:44:45,102 --> 00:44:47,086
For I am Power!

468
00:44:47,086 --> 00:44:49,094
Are you to be my so-called partner?!

469
00:44:50,089 --> 00:44:52,103
Power?! Your name's Power?!

470
00:44:52,103 --> 00:44:54,084
And you're a Fiend?!

471
00:44:54,084 --> 00:44:57,073
Are Fiends allowed to be Devil Hunters?!

472
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:03,068
Well, whatever! Nice to meet you!

473
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:07,114
Fiends, like devils, \Nare targets for extermination.

474
00:45:07,114 --> 00:45:09,162
But Power's highly rational,

475
00:45:09,162 --> 00:45:12,089
so she's been on Hayakawa's team.

476
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,101
I mentioned this before,

477
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:17,140
but Public Safety Devil Extermination \NSpecial Division 4 is an experimental unit.

478
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,104
The higher-ups will be looking \Nto dissolve your team as soon as possible

479
00:45:21,104 --> 00:45:23,115
if you can't get results.

480
00:45:23,142 --> 00:45:27,134
I don't need to explain what would happen \Nto you two if that happens, do I?

481
00:45:33,142 --> 00:45:36,133
Power's horns stand out a bit too much,

482
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:39,159
so you'll want to patrol areas \Nwithout a lot of pedestrians.

483
00:45:50,106 --> 00:45:53,106
Human! Provide me with something \Nto kill immediately!

484
00:45:53,106 --> 00:45:55,127
I am starved for blood!

485
00:45:58,132 --> 00:46:02,097
I can put up with crazy, \Nas long as she's hot enough.

486
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:06,096
The question is, how do I get \Nmy hands on those boobs?

487
00:46:09,081 --> 00:46:11,158
If you run into any civilian Devil Hunters,

488
00:46:11,158 --> 00:46:15,083
or the police try to question you \Nabout what you're doing...

489
00:46:12,161 --> 00:46:15,082
We've got a pair of suspicious individuals...

490
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:15,083
Excuse me, I need to ask you—

491
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:18,108
We're with Public Safety Devil \NExtermination Special Division 4.

492
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,100
...say that, show them your ID,

493
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,095
and they'll make a sour face \Nand leave you alone.

494
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:27,105
Where the hell are all the devils?!

495
00:46:27,105 --> 00:46:30,114
This is likely my fault!

496
00:46:30,114 --> 00:46:34,131
Before becoming a Fiend, \NI was a devil that was feared by all!

497
00:46:35,089 --> 00:46:38,081
Demonic peons will likely flee \Nthe moment they catch my scent!

498
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:41,069
Wait, how are we gonna \Nget anything done, then?!

499
00:46:42,082 --> 00:46:45,157
If you have any questions, \Njust ask Hayakawa.

500
00:46:46,121 --> 00:46:48,132
He's the one who put you two together.

501
00:46:48,132 --> 00:46:52,070
That asshole! He set me up!

502
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:55,110
He stuck me with Power \Nso I can't do anything cool!

503
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:57,129
He's trying to get me fired!

504
00:47:01,078 --> 00:47:02,154
The scent of blood!

505
00:47:04,105 --> 00:47:07,080
Whoa! Hey, crazy, where you going?!

506
00:47:10,155 --> 00:47:13,083
The game is afoot!

507
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:14,147
The battle is joined!

508
00:47:14,152 --> 00:47:15,164
Damn, she's fast!

509
00:47:15,164 --> 00:47:19,140
The scene's evacuated and blocked off.

510
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,127
It's the Sea Cucumber Devil. \NYes, the Sea Cucumber Devil.

511
00:47:22,127 --> 00:47:25,091
Requesting backup \Nin front of Nerima Station.

512
00:47:25,091 --> 00:47:27,096
I said, it's the Sea Cucumber—

513
00:47:27,096 --> 00:47:29,078
Do you know what a sea cucumber is?

514
00:47:29,104 --> 00:47:31,140
Look, I'm trying to say—

515
00:47:36,109 --> 00:47:37,118
What the...?

516
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:41,159
Did you see?! The kill is mine!

517
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,165
If Public Safety kills \Na civilian hunter's devil,

518
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,226
we're guilty of obstructing their business.

519
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,216
Normally, you'd be arrested \Nfor that kind of thing.

520
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:51,202
Power, you're going to need \Nto think a bit more before acting.

521
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:54,213
And you'll have to get her \Nunder control, Denji.

522
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,217
I'm in trouble, too?

523
00:49:56,243 --> 00:50:00,233
Before becoming a Fiend, \NPower was the Blood Devil...

524
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:03,233
So she's got a talent \Nfor using blood in battle,

525
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,203
but also gets worked up pretty easily.

526
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:09,238
Maybe she's not cut out to be \Na Devil Hunter after all.

527
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,256
It...

528
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:14,258
I-It was he who commanded me to kill!

529
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:19,180
I did not! How can you just lie like that?!

530
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,232
It is no lie! It was him!

531
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:25,168
The human ordered me to kill \Nthis devil! That's the truth!

532
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,169
What a creep!

533
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,189
Miss Makima, this devil's a total liar!

534
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,284
You oughta arrest her right now!

535
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:34,211
You're under arrest for the crime \Nof being a fake-ass liar!

536
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,237
Not true! It was by his command!

537
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:40,216
Devils do not lie! It is only humans who do!

538
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:42,241
No one ever said that!

539
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:46,161
And you're the reason why! \NDumbass! Shitty liar!

540
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,196
Humans and your filthy lies!

541
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,249
I only did as I was told!

542
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:54,222
Why the hell do you talk like \Nthat anyway?! It's so creepy!

543
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,216
Could you quiet down?

544
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,189
Y-Yes.

545
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,231
Very good, Power.

546
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:10,186
Honestly, I don't really care \Nwho got in whose way.

547
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,235
I want to see the two of you \Nworking well together.

548
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:16,185
Can you show me that?

549
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,237
We... W-We can.

550
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:48,264
Maybe I should worry about \Ncopping a feel some other time.

551
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:10,254
Y'know, being able to just grab a drink \Nlike this is a dream come true to me.

552
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,261
But if we keep screwing up,

553
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:17,211
being thirsty is probably gonna be \Nthe least of my problems.

554
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:22,216
Not that it'll make it any easier to work \Nwith some chick that lies, though.

555
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:27,218
I only enjoy the company of cats.

556
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,199
I hate humans.

557
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:34,182
It's not a matter of personal grievance.

558
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:36,252
My hatred is almost like a demonic instinct.

559
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,174
And I hate devils, too.

560
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:42,266
Since one of them took \Nmy pet Meowy away.

561
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:49,178
Before I was able to recover Meowy, \NI fell into Makima's clutches.

562
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:53,194
My dear Meowy may be dead already, and yet...\NI find it hard to give up hope.

563
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,151
If it lets me retrieve Meowy \Nfrom that demon,

564
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,234
I'm willing to abide humans, \Nor anything else I needs must.

565
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:03,252
I doubt you'd understand \Nsuch concern for a cat.

566
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:07,249
For a cat? That's dumb as hell.

567
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,236
But I'd do whatever it takes \Nto get to fondle some boobs.

568
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:16,230
It seems I may never understand humans.

569
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:23,192
But I think I'd get you if it was a dog.

570
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:28,230
What would you say to the \Nprospect of fondling my chest

571
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,216
after retrieving Meowy from that devil?

572
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,234
That {\i1}fucking{\i0} devil...

573
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:41,240
thinks he can just kidnap some poor cat?!

574
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,225
Well, I don't think so!

575
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:49,221
As a Devil Hunter, I say no!

576
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:55,192
I'm gonna kill the shit out of that devil!

577
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:33,229
Leave for the Fiend, Power, is approved.

578
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,242
Make sure to have her back by 5:00 PM.

579
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,261
You're not even allowed to \Ngo out on your own?

580
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:44,205
Indeed. I've had to idly while \Naway my time in here.

581
00:55:57,228 --> 00:56:01,163
I know where the devil \Nthat kidnapped Meowy dwells.

582
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,275
The concern is that you are \Nthe only one who can fight it.

583
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:09,250
He's likely to use Meowy \Nas a shield upon seeing me.

584
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:13,163
If that happens, then all is lost.

585
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:19,237
I had a pet devil named Pochita, y'know?

586
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:24,163
I can't pet him anymore, but it's cool.

587
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,176
Because he's alive in here.

588
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,226
How foolish you humans are.

589
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:34,182
Does that not mean Pochita is dead?

590
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:38,187
Death is the absence of life. \NThis nonsense about living on in your heart

591
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,214
is little more than miserable self-comfort.

592
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:50,235
Uh-huh. I guess so.

593
00:56:56,204 --> 00:57:00,255
I don't think I'm ever \Ngonna get along with her.

594
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:13,251
The American matter has got the Soviet \Nwar hawks crowing more loudly than ever.

595
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:18,190
There are rumors about \Nthe military use of devils, as well.

596
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:23,257
Hopefully, devils will remain \NJapan's only enemies in the future.

597
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:26,153
Makima, how are the hunting dogs

598
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,199
that have been added \Nto the squad performing?

599
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:33,228
There's one that seems promising, \Nand another that seems interesting.

600
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,217
Interesting...?

601
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:37,230
A pup that I just recently picked up.

602
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:43,211
Your job is to raise these hounds, \Nand then put them to work.

603
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,182
Make sure not to grow attached.

604
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,183
As far as I can tell, \NDenji's disgusting, not "interesting."

605
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,235
Why do you have such high hopes for him?

606
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:28,189
All devils are born with names.

607
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:31,251
And the more those names are feared,

608
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:34,213
the more powerful the devil \Nis said to become.

609
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:39,216
Coffee isn't considered very frightening,

610
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:42,261
so a Coffee Devil would probably be weak.

611
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:46,255
But what about a Car Devil?

612
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:51,203
It's easy to imagine being run over \Nand dying, so it would probably be strong.

613
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:57,190
And Denji can turn into a Chainsaw Devil.

614
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,212
Seems pretty interesting to me.

615
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,228
He might be interesting, \Nbut I'm not sure he'll be any use.

616
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:14,234
Everyone in Public Safety has \Na real goal or motivation.

617
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:18,210
But he said he just wants \Nto live the good life.

618
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,225
He's a bad fit for our operation.

619
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:25,162
Not only that, but he thinks \Nhe can be friends with devils.

620
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:29,209
He's still a kid. A stupid brat.

621
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:44,205
That is the house!

622
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,234
Meowy and the devil are in there.

623
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,250
Well, we better get going, then.

624
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:03,239
Hope I don't have to chainsaw out. \NLosing all that blood's a drag.

625
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,242
Chainsaw?

626
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:09,199
Yeah. I can turn into a buncha chainsaws.

627
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,226
Human jokes leave much to be desired.

628
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:19,194
What is it now?

629
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:23,193
Isn't he gonna use the cat \Nas a hostage if he sees you?

630
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:26,202
Should you even, like, be this close?

631
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:29,256
Oh, I did say that, didn't I?

632
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,200
You {\i1}said{\i0}...?

633
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,185
I misspoke.

634
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:53,166
Fool that you are, it seems \Nyour instincts are sharp.

635
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:22,237
You kept me waiting \Na long time, Blood Devil.

636
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,198
I thought you had run away.

637
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:29,248
Spare me your complaints! \NIt took me this long to gain some freedom.

638
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:34,204
And I've brought a human \Njust as you demanded, Bat!

639
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,244
My first meal in ages...

640
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:45,231
A young man? I'm sure his \Nblood will be full of vigor.

641
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:55,181
Look at my arm, human.

642
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:58,169
The wound that your kind gave me!

643
01:01:58,172 --> 01:02:03,219
The damnable wound \Nthat forced me into hiding!

644
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:06,184
Like I give a shit. Dumbass.

645
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,216
Food shouldn't speak!

646
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:14,218
Time to heal the wounds humans \Ngave me with human blood!

647
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:22,197
Disgusting!

648
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:30,227
I've been revived with awful-tasting blood!

649
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:37,197
The inside of my mouth tastes disgusting...

650
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:41,173
I need to cleanse my palate \Nwith another human now!

651
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:52,175
What are you trying to do? \NMake friends with them?

652
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:01,182
I'm amazed you actually believed my story.

653
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,267
Humans truly are foolish.

654
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:16,257
The stench of cigarettes...

655
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:20,156
The scent of makeup and drugs...

656
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:20,252
Are you serious?

657
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,260
Wow!

658
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:26,192
There's a decent aroma.

659
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:29,227
I'll cleanse my palate with some children.

660
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,259
Bat Devil!

661
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:36,191
I brought you a human, as promised!

662
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,219
Release Meowy.

663
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:45,207
Oh, I did say I'd do that, didn't I?

664
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,200
Meowy!

665
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:55,251
But I hadn't punished you for bringing me \Nsuch nasty blood yet, had I?

666
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,234
Meowy...?

667
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:03,191
Meowy!

668
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,214
Your name shall be Meowy!

669
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:08,216
You smell tasty, for a cat.

670
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:15,195
So spindly, though.

671
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:19,232
Let's put some meat \Non those bones before I feast.

672
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,234
Grow big and strong, now.

673
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:35,200
I'm looking forward to killing you, Meowy.

674
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:48,225
I've killed all who've met my eyes.

675
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:54,179
It's become strange to hear a voice \Nthat isn't screaming.

676
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,160
So strange...

677
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,232
Blood Devil...

678
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:10,194
I need blood.

679
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:16,229
If you want to save this cat, \Nthen bring me a human.

680
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,184
You said you couldn't pet \NPochita anymore, yes?

681
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,184
I understand how you feel now.

682
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,197
'Tis an awful feeling.

683
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:54,192
Nasty!

684
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,213
All of this repulsive blood!

685
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:04,178
The inside of my mouth feels filthy!

686
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:07,156
I need to gargle with the blood of children!

687
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:16,180
After I gargle, a virgin \Nshould make a fine appetizer.

688
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:19,239
Then a beefy man for a main course...

689
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:22,194
And a pregnant woman for dessert.

690
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:29,175
Gimme my tits back!

691
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:33,193
You're drinking my blood?! \NThat's disgusting!

692
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:36,260
I don't even feel like drinking your blood!

693
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,193
There was a time I couldn't find Pochita.

694
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:45,198
He was gone when I woke up in the morning...

695
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:48,189
So I looked all over town, \Nbut couldn't find him.

696
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:52,223
I thought a devil might've eaten him,

697
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:58,175
but when I got home, \Nhe was crying, waiting for me.

698
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:02,222
I remember being so relieved, \NI fell asleep holding him.

699
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:11,193
I wonder how she felt when she tried to sleep,\Nknowing that devil had Meowy.

700
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:26,221
You're a devil?!

701
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:54,243
Hey, dumbass! You wanna get eaten?!

702
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:59,256
You let her escape?

703
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:04,170
You're a devil! \NWhat do you think you're doing?!

704
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:08,171
Think I'm gonna split open your guts...

705
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,231
And then cop me a feel!

706
01:08:52,252 --> 01:08:53,267
Get out of here already!

707
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:07,167
If you're so set on saving humans...

708
01:09:09,185 --> 01:09:11,249
Can you cut through this?!

709
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:17,240
The chainsaws retract?!

710
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:20,179
Such brute strength in that tiny body!

711
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:23,216
Why would you use that power \Nto save a human?!

712
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:27,238
You think I saved him?

713
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,225
{\b1\fs30\fnVerdana\fscy125}Western Tokyo

714
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:32,225
I don't give a shit...

715
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:35,176
about saving some {\i1}dude{\i0}!

716
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:08,219
I need to heal now.

717
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:11,229
Your blood reeks of cigarettes, \Nbut it should do, for now.

718
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:18,168
How are you still alive?!

719
01:10:20,215 --> 01:10:23,271
Through all of this crap...

720
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:27,240
I've been about as patient as possible.

721
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:33,201
So how come I haven't...

722
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:38,243
gotten to cop a single damn feel yet?!

723
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:55,240
S-Stay away!
