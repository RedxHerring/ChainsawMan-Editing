1
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:53,031
If you want to save this cat, \Nthen bring me a human.

2
00:00:58,062 --> 00:01:00,087
One life is worth as little as any other.

3
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:03,012
And this is only a cat.

4
00:01:03,088 --> 00:01:07,037
So why do I run? \NWhy do I search for a human?

5
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:12,088
Is it to save Meowy?

6
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:19,078
Such a foolish reason.

7
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:26,007
I love blood.

8
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,044
The taste, the smell, \Nthe sense of mortality...

9
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:35,097
And then... there is something \NI only recently realized:

10
00:01:37,032 --> 00:01:39,028
The blood is warm...

11
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:42,027
And feels pleasant.

12
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,069
Why did you save me?

13
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:09,095
I attempted to kill you.

14
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,049
Such a foolish reason.

15
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:36,005
Forgive my deceit.

16
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:38,067
Since Meowy is safe...

17
00:02:39,054 --> 00:02:41,046
You may fondle my chest.

18
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:59,086
Hell {\i1}yeah{\i0}!

19
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:03,062
Holy shit! Ow!

20
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:06,025
That hurts!

21
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,081
Can you move?

22
00:05:03,043 --> 00:05:05,028
Not even a finger.

23
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:08,003
Take Meowy and flee, please.

24
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:20,034
Damn it, not enough chainsaw...

25
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:24,001
I must be low on blood.

26
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,010
And after I finally found him...

27
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:34,039
It's you, right? The one who killed Batty.

28
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:37,028
He was my man, y'know?!

29
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:43,054
Oh... but you're actually \Npretty cute yourself.

30
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:47,078
You're my type, so I'll let you go!

31
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,028
What about them?

32
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,075
They die.

33
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:03,009
Then you can die, too.

34
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:40,048
He can fight so fiercely...

35
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:43,084
To merely fondle a chest?

36
00:06:59,058 --> 00:07:01,031
Is this a joke?

37
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:05,032
How'd a little pupper \Nlike you kill my Batty?

38
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:13,009
Y'know, he and I shared a dream: \Nkilling and eating all of humanity.

39
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:17,008
A pipe dream, but a noble one, \Nand a romantic one.

40
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:20,047
And now this little \Nyipping dog has ruined it.

41
00:07:21,015 --> 00:07:23,098
You're cute enough that I regret it...

42
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:26,034
But you still need to die.

43
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,059
I'm not dying before I cop a feel.

44
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:32,039
That is ridiculous!

45
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,006
To think he was killed by someone \Nwith such a trashy dream.

46
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:38,085
Alas, poor Batty...

47
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,027
Such a foolish reason.

48
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:46,019
Everyone is serious about this except you.

49
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:13,038
Everybody wants to trash-talk my plans...

50
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:14,089
It's revenge this,

51
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:16,064
protect my family that,

52
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:18,014
and save a cat, too!

53
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:20,014
Blah, blah, blah!

54
00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:23,014
I guess your fancy dreams \Nmake you guys hot shit, huh?!

55
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:26,010
How about we have us a dream battle, then?! \NHow about that?!

56
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,002
If I murderize you,

57
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:32,065
that means your dream's \Nweaker than fondling a tit!

58
00:08:32,065 --> 00:08:34,058
Even your howls are cute!

59
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:36,086
But y'know what they say about \Nlittle dogs barking! Yap, yap, yap!

60
00:08:36,086 --> 00:08:40,029
Okay! I'll gobble you up, then!

61
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:42,041
Go ahead...

62
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:46,090
If you can beat me in the dream battle!

63
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:23,054
Demoniacal...

64
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:05,012
Time to {\i1}eat{\i0}...

65
00:10:10,097 --> 00:10:11,088
Kon.

66
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:20,039
Huh... Huh?

67
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,089
Looks like she's the Leech Devil. \NMay I swallow?

68
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,002
Do it.

69
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,083
The Leech Devil's extermination is confirmed.

70
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:48,006
I want the rookies handling search \Nand rescue, plus assisting with the evac.

71
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:49,016
Yes, sir!

72
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:52,068
Himeno, you've got seniority, \Nso keep watch for more devils.

73
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,060
On it.

74
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:59,005
Dream battle... Gonna... My dream battle...

75
00:10:59,048 --> 00:11:01,099
You and the Blood Fiend \Nneed to be debriefed.

76
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,088
And Meowy?

77
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:13,061
Have the cat sent to a veterinarian \Nfor a thorough checkup.

78
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:30,078
I found your arm.

79
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:34,008
A blood infusion was all \Nit needed to reattach.

80
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:36,098
You really are like a devil.

81
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:41,034
{\i1}You{\i0} seemed pretty friendly \Nwith that devil back there.

82
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:43,023
I saw.

83
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,022
You really don't know a thing, huh?

84
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,082
Devil Hunters form contracts with \Ndevils in order to fight against them.

85
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:55,056
I've got a contract with the Fox Devil.

86
00:11:55,098 --> 00:12:00,060
In exchange for power, \NI offer up a bit of my body as food.

87
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:03,028
It was some skin this time.

88
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:06,011
Sounds painful.

89
00:12:07,021 --> 00:12:09,077
Devils yearn for the deaths of humans.

90
00:12:10,038 --> 00:12:12,054
The same goes for Fiends.

91
00:12:14,002 --> 00:12:16,042
Power seems cool, though.

92
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:23,089
The surveillance cameras caught \Nyou two headed to your patrol area.

93
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:24,093
{\an7\pos(120,85)\bord0\c&HC0CCC4&\fs35}Paused

94
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:29,006
And the house that we believe \Nwas housing the Bat Devil

95
00:12:29,006 --> 00:12:31,022
contained a lot of your spilt blood.

96
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:35,050
The Blood Fiend tried to kill you, didn't she?

97
00:12:36,034 --> 00:12:41,011
I don't know why, but you're trying \Nto protect a devil. Again.

98
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,086
I dunno... {\i1}is{\i0} that how it happened?

99
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:52,018
My daughter would like \Nto meet the chainsaw guy.

100
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:53,051
Thank you.

101
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:58,006
The devil threatened to eat \Nme back at the office,

102
00:12:58,006 --> 00:13:00,060
but now that I think about it, he was \Nwearing a Public Safety uniform.

103
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,019
I'd like to thank him.

104
00:13:02,093 --> 00:13:05,024
"Don't give a shit about \Nsaving some dude," he says!

105
00:13:05,024 --> 00:13:07,036
And then the devil throws \Nmy car with me in it!

106
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,059
It was a devil with a chainsaw \Ncoming out of its head...

107
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:16,064
If I dig deeper into this, \Nand report it to the higher-ups,

108
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:20,014
it'd mean the Blood Fiend gets disposed of\N along with you, since you covered for her.

109
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,090
But there were no fatalities.

110
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:27,041
So, if you're willing to accept one condition, \NI'll let what happened slide.

111
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,059
You need to do what I tell you to.

112
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,017
You're a dumbass and a brat \Nwith no clue about right and wrong.

113
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:42,058
I've been doing this longer, so I'm pretty\N sure I have some grasp of social ethics.

114
00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:47,043
All you need to do to protect \Nthis lifestyle is listen to me.

115
00:13:50,026 --> 00:13:52,093
How about it? If you follow, \NI want an answer.

116
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:58,044
Sure. I'll keep it in mind.

117
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:01,060
You can relax.

118
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:05,041
I might not be after some \Nbig-deal goal like you guys,

119
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,093
and I might dream small.

120
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,070
But I'm as serious about this as you are.

121
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:15,051
You can count on me.

122
00:14:19,065 --> 00:14:22,021
Try and learn some manners in the meantime.

123
00:14:22,053 --> 00:14:25,068
Yeah, I'll think about it.

124
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,053
You see? Am I not innocent?

125
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,048
Now, would you kindly take these off?

126
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:43,012
Is this a good idea?

127
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:46,040
When this cutie-Fiend kills somebody,

128
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,024
it's gonna be your responsibility, \Nfor letting her live.

129
00:14:49,024 --> 00:14:51,084
We're Devil Hunters.

130
00:14:51,084 --> 00:14:53,063
Whether they're devils or Fiends,

131
00:14:53,063 --> 00:14:55,094
if they're handy, \Nwe should put them to work.

132
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,012
But they're still the enemy. \NWe're just making use of them.

133
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,037
We're not making friends.

134
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,074
Come in.

135
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:38,051
Excuse me.

136
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:51,019
And he claims they "were outside \Nthe patrol zone before they knew it,"

137
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:55,071
and that they discovered a house that\N"looked like it had a super-nasty devil in it,"

138
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:58,024
which is where they encountered \Nthe Bat Devil.

139
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:02,027
Denji used his chainsaws to\N exterminate the Bat Devil,

140
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:05,018
and then came under attack \Nby the Leech Devil...

141
00:16:05,018 --> 00:16:07,061
Which Division 4 exterminated.

142
00:16:08,003 --> 00:16:12,074
There were no traces of Gun flesh \Nin either the Bat or Leech Devil's heads.

143
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,058
That concludes my report.

144
00:16:17,056 --> 00:16:18,090
Well done.

145
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:26,088
But Denji and Power managed to get awfully \Nfar without anyone noticing, didn't they?

146
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,013
I'd chalk that up to them \Nbeing unbelievably stupid.

147
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:34,050
Leaving the approved area \Nis against regulations.

148
00:16:34,088 --> 00:16:37,034
Considering there were no fatalities,

149
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:42,006
and that we were able to get rid of \Ntwo devils, I think it's worth overlooking.

150
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,027
Understood.

151
00:16:49,077 --> 00:16:51,088
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.

152
00:16:53,018 --> 00:16:56,057
You seem a little more \Nflexible now, Hayakawa.

153
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:01,064
Is that Denji's influence, I wonder?

154
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,035
I doubt it.

155
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:07,037
I haven't changed at all.

156
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,026
How's he up so early?

157
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:08,098
What's for lunch?

158
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,062
Curry.

159
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,098
Sweet!

160
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:18,001
The hell's this? A devil?

161
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:27,092
What a pitiful home this is!

162
00:19:31,027 --> 00:19:35,088
I'd like you to put Power up \Nin one of your rooms, Hayakawa.

163
00:19:36,027 --> 00:19:41,028
I think you'll make a good leash \Nfor the two of them.

164
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:43,094
Stop right there, Meowy!

165
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:47,021
It seems you've got quite a feast!

166
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:49,041
Damn it, who said you could come in?!

167
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,052
'Tis mine now!

168
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:52,067
Gimme my super toast back!

169
00:19:53,022 --> 00:19:55,042
Oh... okay.

170
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:58,075
It'd be a little odd to have her \Nstaying at the office indefinitely.

171
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,042
Okay.

172
00:20:04,057 --> 00:20:09,037
You don't need to worry. \NPower said she would behave.

173
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,031
It'll be fine.

174
00:20:13,069 --> 00:20:15,029
Vegetables are revolting!

175
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:16,004
Away!

176
00:20:16,043 --> 00:20:17,039
Carrot!

177
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,097
Don't fling your vegetables!

178
00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:21,008
Damn it...

179
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:25,036
Show some respect to the farmers \Nwho grew the veggies, devil!

180
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:28,020
The toilet?

181
00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:30,083
I prefer to only occasionally \Nflush my feces.

182
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,005
Flush it!

183
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:33,046
It stinks.

184
00:20:33,076 --> 00:20:35,067
I prefer to only occasionally bathe.

185
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,087
Get in there!

186
00:20:36,087 --> 00:20:38,034
You reek!

187
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:40,050
You two are absurd.

188
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,097
How delicate these humans be.

189
00:20:42,097 --> 00:20:44,034
Aren't they, Meowy?

190
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:57,036
Can't believe she just shows up \Nand starts raising hell.

191
00:20:57,036 --> 00:21:00,011
Do devils not flush the toilet?

192
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:02,022
Didn't eat her veggies either.

193
00:21:02,022 --> 00:21:03,061
You there...

194
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:09,037
Hey, Shit Devil! Your turds are stuck \Nto the damn toilet and won't come off!

195
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:18,009
We had a deal, did we not?

196
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:20,029
You may fondle my chest.

197
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:21,063
So, fondle!

198
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:40,069
Come now, what's the matter? \NAren't you pleased?

199
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:42,023
Commence your fondling.

200
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:49,049
I have stipulations, however.

201
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:54,012
You have earned three squeezes of my breast.

202
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:56,007
Three?

203
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:59,032
One for your rescue of Meowy.

204
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:02,010
A second for slaying the Bat Devil.

205
00:22:02,048 --> 00:22:06,066
And a third for protecting me from topknot!

206
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,097
I had no intention of actually letting you,

207
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,047
but your efforts have earned \Nyou these three squeezes.

208
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:15,044
Squeeze them gratefully.

209
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:24,019
She's an angel!

210
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:27,099

00:24:18,116 --> 00:24:19,193

216
00:24:33,143 --> 00:24:34,156
What the...?

217
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:36,159
Breast pads.

218
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,156
A wondrous invention that \Nmakes your bosom look bigger.

219
00:24:44,118 --> 00:24:46,119
Now! Two squeezes remain.

220
00:24:56,116 --> 00:24:58,123
And now! The final fondling!

221
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,146
There, done! All done!

222
00:25:04,146 --> 00:25:07,139
What did you think? Was it not fantastic?

223
00:25:08,193 --> 00:25:11,137
How lucky for you, to grasp \Nsuch splendorous things!

224
00:25:11,137 --> 00:25:13,147
And now we are even!

225
00:25:13,147 --> 00:25:18,109
With Meowy saved, I have no real reason \Nto hunt devils any longer,

226
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:19,173
There's lots of stuff I could say, but... Huh?

227
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:20,148
yet there's no escaping Makima!

228
00:25:20,148 --> 00:25:23,104
So I will aid you all with your duty!

229
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,181
I'm sure the pleasure is all yours!

230
00:25:27,135 --> 00:25:28,193
Meowy! Off to bed we go!

231
00:25:35,126 --> 00:25:36,152
That's it?

232
00:27:14,121 --> 00:27:16,157
This is good!

233
00:27:18,122 --> 00:27:20,129
Seconds would be splendid!

234
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:21,159
I'll eat yours, if you won't have it!

235
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:22,122
You little...!

236
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:25,123
Where shall we slaughter devils today?

237
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:27,193
Hey.

238
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,119
Hey!

239
00:27:31,123 --> 00:27:32,189
Hey!

240
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,124
Chop!

241
00:27:36,192 --> 00:27:39,174
This is the form apology \Nfor the damage to the buildings.

242
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:43,163
This is for verifying \Nthe disposal of the devils' bodies.

243
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:47,109
Then there's this, from the Ministry of Land, \NInfrastructure, Transport and Tourism.

244
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:49,125
You'll need to stamp it, here and here.

245
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:58,167
I hate making you do all this paperwork.

246
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:02,151
It's almost like killing \Nthe Bat Devil was a bad thing.

247
00:28:04,163 --> 00:28:08,102
Is something bothering you, Denji?

248
00:28:10,195 --> 00:28:12,102
Y'know, I...

249
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,151
There's something I was chasing after, \Nand I finally managed to get it.

250
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:20,102
But once I did, it wasn't...

251
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:23,178
as big of a deal as I thought.

252
00:28:24,131 --> 00:28:30,108
Now I'm wondering, if I go after \Nsomething else, and get my hands on it,

253
00:28:31,124 --> 00:28:36,102
am I just gonna think \NI was happier during the chase?

254
00:28:38,102 --> 00:28:41,170
That's, like... total bullshit, isn't it?

255
00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:47,106
What exactly are you talking about, Denji?

256
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:52,156
I touched boobs for the first time,\N but it wasn't that great.

257
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,170
Denji...

258
00:29:04,106 --> 00:29:05,170
I believe that, when it comes to sex,

259
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:11,187
the better you understand \Nthe other person, the better it feels.

260
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:19,108
But it's hard to understand \Nhow someone else feels.

261
00:29:20,174 --> 00:29:24,122
So, start with observing \Nthe hand, carefully.

262
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:29,135
How long are their fingers?

263
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:35,174
Are their palms cold?

264
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:37,183
Are they warm?

265
00:29:39,155 --> 00:29:41,110
What's the shape of their ears?

266
00:29:46,116 --> 00:29:48,149
Ever had your finger bitten?

267
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:49,175
B-Bit...?

268
00:29:49,175 --> 00:29:51,110
Remember this.

269
00:29:52,108 --> 00:29:54,191
So that even if you can't see,

270
00:29:55,188 --> 00:30:00,176
you'll be able to tell it's me, \Nfrom how hard I'm biting.

271
00:30:02,143 --> 00:30:03,169
Memorize it.

272
00:30:14,148 --> 00:30:16,152
I... got it.

273
00:30:47,156 --> 00:30:49,105
Denji...

274
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:53,106
I'd like to ask you to do something for me.

275
00:30:53,175 --> 00:30:54,194
Can I?

276
00:30:57,111 --> 00:30:58,119
Yeah.

277
00:31:03,158 --> 00:31:06,112
I want you to beat the Gun Devil.

278
00:31:07,104 --> 00:31:08,150
Gun Devil?

279
00:31:09,149 --> 00:31:15,155
It appeared in America 13 years ago, \Nbut nobody knows where it is now.

280
00:31:16,118 --> 00:31:21,134
It's a very strong devil \Nthat all hunters want to kill.

281
00:31:23,102 --> 00:31:27,125
But I happen to think that you can kill it.

282
00:31:27,197 --> 00:31:32,160
Because you're not like any \Nof the other Devil Hunters.

283
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,198
And if you're able to kill the Gun Devil,

284
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:41,181
I'll make any wish of yours come true.

285
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,148
You're saying if your Denji\N kills the Gun Devil,

286
00:31:47,148 --> 00:31:52,124
Miss Makima's gonna make \Nany wish of his come true?

287
00:31:54,197 --> 00:31:57,173
So... like, I mean...

288
00:31:58,145 --> 00:32:00,163
You're saying if your Denji\N kills the Gun Devil,

289
00:32:00,163 --> 00:32:04,151
Miss Makima's gonna make \N{\i1}any{\i0} wish of his come true?

290
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:12,147
{\i1}Anything{\i0}, like... even se—

291
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:14,177
I said anything, Denji.

292
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,152
Holy shit! Is that even allowed?!

293
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:23,158
It's only allowed because this devil \Nis so strong and bad, mind you.

294
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:26,147
People were trying to profit off of guns

295
00:32:26,147 --> 00:32:28,198
as a counter-measure against \Ndevils across the world,

296
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:32,104
which resulted in an increase \Nin crime and conflict.

297
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,121
The news focused on it \Nnon-stop for a while,

298
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:40,125
with people more afraid \Nof gun violence than ever.

299
00:32:41,137 --> 00:32:45,167
Then a major armed terrorist \Nattack happened in America.

300
00:32:46,134 --> 00:32:49,127
That was the day the Gun Devil appeared.

301
00:32:53,112 --> 00:32:58,189
"This is where I live," said the city mouse.

302
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,189

00:32:59,194 --> 00:33:03,141
And, oh what a big house it was!

304
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:05,127
The city mouse's family—

305
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:05,127
Dad!

306
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,186
Let's play catch outside.

307
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:12,121
Taiyo doesn't feel well. \NFind something you can play by yourself.

308
00:33:12,163 --> 00:33:14,141
He never does.

309
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:16,129
I don't remember him feeling good.

310
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:20,129
You're the older brother. \NBe good and play by yourself.

311
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:23,122
I...

312
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:26,180
I wanna play with him.

313
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,139
Quit following me.

314
00:33:52,121 --> 00:33:54,149
You're so annoying... I said cut it out!

315
00:33:58,151 --> 00:34:00,122
I'm gonna play by myself.

316
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:07,198
Gotcha!

317
00:34:10,185 --> 00:34:12,192
Stupid! I said cut it out!

318
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:22,193
It's cold...

319
00:34:29,123 --> 00:34:32,171
If you catch a cold, \NI'm gonna get in trouble.

320
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:38,138
Your hands won't get cold \Nif we play catch, right?

321
00:34:39,135 --> 00:34:41,106
Go grab a glove from the house.

322
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,144
Yes!

323
00:35:05,198 --> 00:35:10,168
In a little under five minutes, \N1.2 million people were killed.

324
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,101
The Gun Devil hasn't been seen since.

325
00:35:20,143 --> 00:35:25,136
Fear of devils across the board \Nincreased as a result,

326
00:35:25,185 --> 00:35:30,127
making them all stronger than ever before.

327
00:35:31,176 --> 00:35:37,149
Gun control got a lot more severe \Nin an attempt to weaken the Gun Devil...

328
00:35:37,149 --> 00:35:41,189
Along with increased censorship of the news.

329
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:45,165
I'm not sure I understand, but...

330
00:35:45,165 --> 00:35:48,165
Let's say this thing's so strong, \Nit's hard to understand.

331
00:35:49,117 --> 00:35:51,165
Do you think you can beat it, Denji?

332
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:54,140
Well... I'd say...

333
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,137
If I bust out all the stops,

334
00:35:58,112 --> 00:36:00,117
it'll be a {\i1}peace{\i0} of cake.

335
00:36:01,113 --> 00:36:02,178
In that case...

336
00:36:02,178 --> 00:36:05,137
First, we'll need to actually \Nfind the Gun Devil.

337
00:36:06,196 --> 00:36:09,146
How exactly are we gonna do that, anyway?

338
00:36:10,149 --> 00:36:13,158
These are pieces of the Gun Devil \Nthat we've collected.

339
00:36:13,158 --> 00:36:17,177
It's so fast, pieces of it \Nare torn off just from moving.

340
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,172
If a devil eats some of this,

341
00:36:20,172 --> 00:36:25,124
no matter what their nature, \Nthey become more powerful.

342
00:36:25,124 --> 00:36:26,181
See how they stick together?

343
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:31,174
Because of how powerful the Gun Devil is,

344
00:36:31,174 --> 00:36:34,159
once the chunks of flesh \Nreach a certain size,

345
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,188
they start to be attracted \Nto the original body.

346
00:36:37,188 --> 00:36:41,145
So if we can make this piece bigger,

347
00:36:42,124 --> 00:36:44,161
it'll lead us to the Gun Devil.

348
00:36:45,145 --> 00:36:46,150
Got one.

349
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:52,150
So it really was snacking \Non a piece of the Gun.

350
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:56,179
Explains how such \Na wimpy devil got so strong.

351
00:36:57,197 --> 00:37:00,174
But did it find that piece, \Nor did someone serve it up?

352
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,139
Doesn't change what our job is.

353
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,177
We keep killing devils,

354
00:37:09,138 --> 00:37:12,179
and eventually, we'll find him.

355
00:37:16,156 --> 00:37:19,115
Public Safety's received a request \Nfor devil extermination.

356
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,116
A devil has been spotted inside of a hotel.

357
00:37:22,116 --> 00:37:24,184
No confirmation on the status \Nof the hotel's guests.

358
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:29,159
Several of the civilian devil hunters \Nwho initially went in have been found dead.

359
00:37:29,191 --> 00:37:34,118
It's believed the target has \Nconsumed a piece of the Gun Devil.

360
00:37:34,184 --> 00:37:39,128
We're sending six agents from Public Safety \NDevil Extermination Special Division 4.

361
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:46,118
It's hiding somewhere in this hotel.

362
00:37:46,118 --> 00:37:49,131
And this is no ordinary devil.

363
00:37:49,161 --> 00:37:52,101
It's eaten a piece of the Gun Devil's flesh.

364
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,119
Maybe it's the Gun Devil for real?

365
00:37:56,123 --> 00:38:00,182
The more flesh, the stronger the attraction. \NThe reaction's not big enough.

366
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:03,120
Huh, guess not.

367
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,195
How amusing... Give that thing to me!

368
00:38:08,115 --> 00:38:10,145
I thought I told you two \Nto work on your manners.

369
00:38:12,162 --> 00:38:16,184
Who the hell's gonna suck up \Nto you for no reason?

370
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:16,184
How foolish and conceited these humans be!

371
00:38:20,149 --> 00:38:22,102
Mr. Hayakawa.

372
00:38:22,102 --> 00:38:23,126
Sir.

373
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:24,148
Good.

374
00:38:24,148 --> 00:38:25,169
Sweet!

375
00:38:26,186 --> 00:38:27,164
Dude, he's so easy.

376
00:38:27,164 --> 00:38:28,176
Hayakawa!

377
00:38:29,128 --> 00:38:32,127
Considering we're about \Nto fight some devils...

378
00:38:32,127 --> 00:38:35,102
Can we really trust these two \Nto watch our backs?

379
00:38:35,149 --> 00:38:38,142
One's a Fiend, and the other is some punk...

380
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:40,171
I'm not sure about this.

381
00:38:42,104 --> 00:38:44,120
We can't let them watch our backs.

382
00:38:44,186 --> 00:38:48,143
On extermination missions, \Nthey'll be taking point.

383
00:38:48,143 --> 00:38:52,142
If they try to run \Nor switch sides, we kill them.

384
00:38:52,187 --> 00:38:55,104
You're treating us like livestock!

385
00:38:55,104 --> 00:38:57,167
You two don't get rights.

386
00:38:58,197 --> 00:39:01,104
He's super pissed.

387
00:39:01,104 --> 00:39:02,157
Must be from this morning.

388
00:39:02,157 --> 00:39:05,105
Perhaps our prank went too far?

389
00:39:05,105 --> 00:39:08,137
You call that a prank?! I could kill you!

390
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,156
Yikes! What happened?

391
00:39:11,103 --> 00:39:14,177
Aki, you can't just be harsh \Nall the time, y'know?

392
00:39:14,177 --> 00:39:18,174
She's right! The bat almost killed me, \Nand now there's more work?!

393
00:39:18,174 --> 00:39:19,194
I want a reward!

394
00:39:21,173 --> 00:39:24,195
Got it! I'll take one for the team.

395
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,186
Whoever kills this devil will win...

396
00:39:27,186 --> 00:39:30,199
a kiss on the cheek from yours truly!

397
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,146
That's... You shouldn't do that!

398
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:38,171
A young woman who's not married \Nshouldn't be so... indecent!

399
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:43,110
But doesn't a reward help with motivation?

400
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,171
Right?

401
00:39:54,168 --> 00:39:56,142
I'm not gonna sweat the kisses.

402
00:39:56,142 --> 00:39:59,123
Don't worry about it. I'm plenty motivated.

403
00:39:59,123 --> 00:40:00,123
Oh?

404
00:40:00,123 --> 00:40:03,173
I got my sights set on someone \Nfor a first kiss already.

405
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:08,117
I'm gonna find all these meat chunks \Nor whatever for her.

406
00:40:08,117 --> 00:40:11,135
So, until the Gun Devil's dead, \Nno smooching for me.

407
00:40:13,184 --> 00:40:16,105
That's a hell of a thing \Nto say in front of Aki!

408
00:40:16,105 --> 00:40:18,187
Besides, I learned something real important.

409
00:40:19,164 --> 00:40:24,106
Sex stuff feels better when it's \Ntwo people who get each other.

410
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:28,138
I don't even know your name, \Nso I ain't after your lips!

411
00:40:33,108 --> 00:40:36,179
Then, if you kill the devil, Denji...

412
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,177
I'll give you a kiss... with tongue.

413
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,128
Hey, hold it!

414
00:40:50,101 --> 00:40:52,153
It's dangerous to run off solo! Stop!

415
00:40:52,153 --> 00:40:56,120
{\move(420,40,640,40)\t(904,1404,\blur1.5}th Floor

416
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:56,102
Damn, I love teasing boys!

417
00:40:56,179 --> 00:40:59,117
Oh man, what are we gonna do?

418
00:40:59,117 --> 00:41:00,179
I yearn for blood.

419
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:03,170
It's dangerous! You need to stop!

420
00:41:06,171 --> 00:41:10,168
Himeno's been nice enough to train me \Nfor the last six months!

421
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:13,184
If the alternative is letting \Nsome thug like you kiss her...

422
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:15,178
Then I'll take that kiss on the cheek!

423
00:41:15,178 --> 00:41:16,181
Move!

424
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:19,136
I don't want some dude \Nall over me! It's nasty!

425
00:41:19,136 --> 00:41:20,129
Say what?!

426
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:24,119
Die! I'm after a way \Nbigger goal than you, dude!

427
00:41:21,194 --> 00:41:24,119
I wish to join you!

428
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:27,147
Shut up! I don't wanna hear that \Nfrom someone newer than me!

429
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,109
What's your take on the rookies, Himeno?

430
00:41:27,147 --> 00:41:29,109
Man, shut up!

431
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:30,154
More of this! Yes!

432
00:41:31,142 --> 00:41:35,145
I'd say Arai's not super competent, \Nbut makes up for it in motivation.

433
00:41:35,145 --> 00:41:37,133
Get him, get him!

434
00:41:36,104 --> 00:41:39,138
Meanwhile, Kobeni's got the moves, \Nbut she's really timid.

435
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,192
You think any of the four rookies \Nhave a shot of surviving, Aki?

436
00:41:43,192 --> 00:41:45,190
It's a duel to the death!

437
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,175
You get the picture, now?

438
00:41:50,134 --> 00:41:53,153
regardless of how strong \NI thought they were.

439
00:41:51,158 --> 00:41:53,193
You are not kissing Himeno!

440
00:41:53,193 --> 00:41:55,150
Asshole... I'm gonna kill you!

441
00:41:54,169 --> 00:41:57,118
That's not really an answer.

442
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,118
Power... you're dead, too!

443
00:41:58,163 --> 00:42:00,168
You too, shorty.

444
00:42:00,168 --> 00:42:01,163
But why?!

445
00:42:17,169 --> 00:42:18,170
Himeno...

446
00:42:19,185 --> 00:42:21,198
This is your new partner.

447
00:42:22,192 --> 00:42:26,119
He's rude, but I trained him \Nto be of some use.

448
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,139
Try and get along.

449
00:42:32,197 --> 00:42:33,184
I'm Aki.

450
00:42:34,168 --> 00:42:35,172
Nice to meet you.

451
00:42:41,198 --> 00:42:43,142
Are you gonna be any help?

452
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:48,161
Well... I think so.

453
00:42:49,158 --> 00:42:52,176
You're gonna be my sixth partner.

454
00:42:52,176 --> 00:42:54,128
The others all died.

455
00:42:55,127 --> 00:42:57,175
They all died because they were useless.

456
00:43:01,135 --> 00:43:03,116
Don't die on me, Aki.

457
00:43:04,154 --> 00:43:08,186
Gotta say, I'm not seeing \Nany devils around here.

458
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,161
Does that meat chunk of yours even work?

459
00:43:16,181 --> 00:43:18,126
So tired...

460
00:43:18,126 --> 00:43:19,132
Aki...

461
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:22,101
Incoming.

462
00:43:46,198 --> 00:43:47,192
Got it.

463
00:43:49,117 --> 00:43:50,104
It floats?!

464
00:43:50,162 --> 00:43:52,138
The battle is joined!

465
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,158
Damnable devil! Did you see \Nhow it floated in fear of me?!

466
00:44:05,164 --> 00:44:07,172
No, no, that's my power.

467
00:44:07,172 --> 00:44:08,156
Say what?

468
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:12,122
I've got a contract with the Ghost Devil.

469
00:44:12,122 --> 00:44:17,105
I served up my right eye in exchange \Nfor being able to use a ghost's right hand.

470
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:21,191
My ghost hand's invisible \Nand strong. Pretty slick, right?

471
00:44:23,102 --> 00:44:26,124
How about it, Aki? \NHas he got any of the Gun's flesh?

472
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:29,158
No strong reaction. This isn't the one.

473
00:44:29,158 --> 00:44:33,103
I see... guess we better keep heading up.

474
00:44:34,181 --> 00:44:39,165
Is it wise to blather on about \Nyour powers in my presence?

475
00:44:39,165 --> 00:44:42,183
Are you people not meant to hold my reins?

476
00:44:42,183 --> 00:44:45,195
Knowing about our powers makes \Nfor better teamwork, right?

477
00:44:45,195 --> 00:44:49,126
Besides, I've got a few tricks \Nup my sleeve, so I'm not worried.

478
00:44:49,126 --> 00:44:51,121
Truly?

479
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:54,132
So what would you do if I said \NI was going to kill this one?

480
00:44:55,161 --> 00:44:57,146
Put the weapon away.

481
00:44:57,146 --> 00:45:00,149
If you misbehave, \NI can always choke you to death.

482
00:45:03,128 --> 00:45:04,199
Can't... touch it...

483
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:14,106
I'd prefer if we got along. It's easier!

484
00:45:16,173 --> 00:45:18,199
I will devour you in time!

485
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:21,126
You better not. I'm trying to get a kiss.

486
00:45:21,172 --> 00:45:25,169
Do you guys not get that the devil \Nis still around? Can't you pipe...

487
00:45:29,155 --> 00:45:30,177
Huh?

488
00:45:36,104 --> 00:45:38,148
She does look like \Nshe'd be unpleasant raw.

489
00:45:37,173 --> 00:45:38,148
What is it?

490
00:45:38,148 --> 00:45:40,180
That sounds pervy, dude.

491
00:45:39,134 --> 00:45:44,128
We were... on our way to \Nthe 9th floor from the 8th, right?

492
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,130
Perhaps boiling or frying...

493
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:45,128
Cook your own ass, stupid.

494
00:45:44,128 --> 00:45:45,128
{\pos(313,41)\fs10\fsp.7}th Floor

495
00:45:46,192 --> 00:45:48,152
But this is the 8th floor.

496
00:45:50,129 --> 00:45:52,117
You probably read it wrong.

497
00:45:52,117 --> 00:45:54,188
It's not that! Something's going on here!

498
00:45:54,188 --> 00:45:55,192
I'm gonna double check.

499
00:45:55,192 --> 00:45:58,145
I know! Grilled like a steak!

500
00:45:58,145 --> 00:45:59,142
Steak?!

501
00:45:59,142 --> 00:46:01,155
I wanna try steak!

502
00:46:04,188 --> 00:46:05,177
Huh?

503
00:46:08,163 --> 00:46:12,169

506
00:47:57,219 --> 00:48:02,257
Arai... just now... you were \Ngoing downstairs, right?

507
00:48:08,225 --> 00:48:11,210
Kobeni, make a double \Npeace sign and stay put.

508
00:48:18,237 --> 00:48:20,158
Well, shit.

509
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:28,172
Aki... what's going on here?

510
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:30,249
It has to be a devil's power at work.

511
00:48:32,189 --> 00:48:34,162
Kobeni, stand right there.

512
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,192
Why are there rooms \Non the other side of the window?

513
00:49:08,162 --> 00:49:10,217
Hey! None of the windows go anywhere!

514
00:49:10,217 --> 00:49:12,198
They just open to the room across the hall!

515
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:15,164
I figured as much.

516
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:19,244
We're trapped on the eighth floor.

00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:01,254
Let's run through what we know.

519
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:04,179
This is probably a devil's doing,

520
00:51:04,179 --> 00:51:07,159
and no matter how many times \Nwe try to go to a different floor,

521
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:08,217
we end up on the eighth again.

522
00:51:08,251 --> 00:51:10,255
The elevator is inoperable \Nfor whatever reason.

523
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,255
There's no way outside via \Nthe rooms or any windows.

524
00:51:14,203 --> 00:51:17,251
We tried going through the ceiling, \Nbut ended up on the eighth floor again.

525
00:51:19,191 --> 00:51:22,251
Maybe it's because Power killed that devil?

526
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:26,204
He coulda died while using \Nthe power to keep us trapped.

527
00:51:26,204 --> 00:51:27,202
And now—

528
00:51:27,202 --> 00:51:29,168
You commanded me to kill him!

529
00:51:29,168 --> 00:51:29,232
Did not!

530
00:51:29,232 --> 00:51:33,257
A devil's powers are released \Nwhen they die. It can't be that.

531
00:51:34,186 --> 00:51:36,232
Is the flesh piece reacting, Aki?

532
00:51:37,162 --> 00:51:38,182
Actually...

533
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:40,255
It's gone dead still.

534
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:46,161
That devil before was bait, and we bit hard.

535
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:49,204
I've never seen a devil try \Nsomething so clever before.

536
00:51:49,243 --> 00:51:52,230
But if no one hears from us for a while,

537
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:55,242
won't other Devil Hunters \Nshow up to help?

538
00:51:57,213 --> 00:52:02,177
I guess we better hope they don't fall \Ninto the same kind of trap, then.

539
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:07,225
We're all gonna die here.

540
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:10,181
We're gonna starve to death.

541
00:52:10,181 --> 00:52:12,223
H-Hang in there, Kobeni!

542
00:52:12,223 --> 00:52:16,194
Didn't you become a Devil Hunter \Nto send your brother to college?!

543
00:52:16,194 --> 00:52:18,220
They basically forced me to do it.

544
00:52:18,253 --> 00:52:21,219
My parents are set on my \Nolder brother going to college,

545
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:23,160
since he's the gifted one.

546
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,170
So they made me get a job.

547
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:30,163
It was become a Devil Hunter \Nor a sex worker!

548
00:52:33,182 --> 00:52:37,167
I wanted to go to college, too!

549
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:41,188
And now I'm gonna die here!

550
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,238
Her face...!

551
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:51,186
Enough!

552
00:52:51,222 --> 00:52:52,252
Quit laughing!

553
00:52:53,226 --> 00:52:57,251
Kobeni, devils love fear, okay?

554
00:52:58,198 --> 00:53:01,212
If you get scared, you're giving them \Nwhat they want, sweetie.

555
00:53:01,212 --> 00:53:04,237
But I'm so scared!

556
00:53:05,256 --> 00:53:07,239
Something bothering you, too, Aki?

557
00:53:10,254 --> 00:53:12,200
The clocks in this room...

558
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:15,225
have been stuck at 8:18 for a while now.

559
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:19,239
In every single room... it's 8:18.

560
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:28,165
There's a chance that time has been \Nfrozen here on the eighth floor.

561
00:53:28,165 --> 00:53:31,178
And if that's the case, no one is coming.

562
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,253
Oh, shit! Then we can sleep all we want, right?

563
00:53:38,225 --> 00:53:40,190
How stupid are you?

564
00:53:40,226 --> 00:53:45,170
We might be trapped in here forever.

565
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:48,226
I mean, we might be, but we\N might {\i1}not{\i0} be, too, y'know?

566
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:50,166
Wake me when you figure it out.

567
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:53,242
This bed is freaking sweet. \NIt'd be stupid not to sleep in it.

568
00:53:54,188 --> 00:53:57,167
I owe the devil for this nap.

569
00:54:07,183 --> 00:54:08,205
He's actually asleep...

570
00:54:12,238 --> 00:54:14,169
Denji.

571
00:54:14,169 --> 00:54:16,228
Rise and shine, Denji.

572
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,216
We find a way off the eighth floor yet?

573
00:54:26,216 --> 00:54:28,220
Hate to break it to you, but not yet.

574
00:54:29,175 --> 00:54:33,215
We found out the water and electricity \Nare still working while you were asleep.

575
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:38,192
There was a little bit of food that some of \Nthe guests who ran must've left behind.

576
00:54:38,252 --> 00:54:42,222
I'll be honest, everyone's really worn out.

577
00:54:43,185 --> 00:54:46,172
Aki's been searching \Nfor the devil nonstop.

578
00:54:46,224 --> 00:54:49,209
I told him to take a break, \Nbut he won't listen.

579
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:53,251
Arai was helping Aki at first,

580
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:57,211
but now he's locked himself up in \Nanother room to have a panic attack.

581
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:02,211
Kobeni freaked out and tried to drink \Ntoilet bowl water, so I knocked her out.

582
00:55:02,254 --> 00:55:05,174
And as for the Fiend...

583
00:55:05,228 --> 00:55:07,199
Something happen to Power?

584
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:10,224
Given there's nothing else to do, \NI've decided to win the Nobel Prize!

585
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:15,200
Once I've earned such glorious esteem, \Nthe humans will all kowtow to me!

586
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,175
And with the Nobel Prize as my foothold,

587
00:55:18,175 --> 00:55:20,168
I shall ascend to the prime minister's throne!

588
00:55:20,168 --> 00:55:23,201
What better way to ensure human suffering?

589
00:55:23,248 --> 00:55:27,172
My first act will be passing a 100% sales tax!

590
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:29,238
She's always like that.

591
00:55:29,238 --> 00:55:32,181
Huh. Okay, then.

592
00:55:33,191 --> 00:55:36,173
Let's take turns watching Kobeni and Arai.

593
00:55:36,173 --> 00:55:38,219
I couldn't even use the bathroom \Nwhen it was just me.

594
00:55:54,186 --> 00:55:57,167
Well, this is my last cigarette.

595
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,254
I'm bored by how little this upsets you.

596
00:55:59,254 --> 00:56:04,242
I can take it easy because \NAki's working hard.

597
00:56:04,242 --> 00:56:07,180
The nicotine also helps!

598
00:56:07,223 --> 00:56:10,255
Gotta have a port in a storm, right?

599
00:56:10,255 --> 00:56:14,194
Life is sweeter with a bit of dependence.

600
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:17,168
Hey, that's the same brand he smokes.

601
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:23,244
That's because Aki learned all \Nabout the flavor of cigarettes

602
00:56:23,244 --> 00:56:25,191
from yours truly!

603
00:56:30,192 --> 00:56:32,170
Not gonna smoke, Aki?

604
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:34,195
No. It's bad for your bones.

605
00:56:34,195 --> 00:56:37,171
You should start. It's great for socializing.

606
00:56:37,197 --> 00:56:39,196
I'm not looking to make friends.

607
00:56:43,196 --> 00:56:46,163
Let me guess why you joined Public Safety.

608
00:56:46,163 --> 00:56:48,172
You're out to kill the Gun Devil, right?

609
00:56:49,247 --> 00:56:53,182
Everyone who signs up with a chip \Non their shoulder is the same...

610
00:56:53,254 --> 00:56:57,235
since only Public Safety is allowed to hold\N onto pieces of the Gun Devil's flesh.

611
00:56:58,187 --> 00:57:02,161
Devil Hunters die young anyway. \NMight as well smoke.

612
00:57:02,235 --> 00:57:04,236
I don't plan on dying any time soon.

613
00:57:05,184 --> 00:57:06,224
I'll hold you to that.

614
00:57:07,172 --> 00:57:09,249
It's a pain in the ass \Nwhen your partner dies.

615
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:18,254
What the hell was that?

616
00:57:19,212 --> 00:57:22,200
She was my old partner's girlfriend.

617
00:57:22,256 --> 00:57:27,163
It happens a lot. You get issues with the\N family and friends of dead partners.

618
00:57:27,163 --> 00:57:30,251
They can't do anything to get back \Nat the devils, so they take it out on me.

619
00:57:31,205 --> 00:57:36,217
I just consider it something \Nthat comes with the territory.

620
00:57:45,223 --> 00:57:47,173
What was that about?

621
00:57:50,246 --> 00:57:54,186
I put gum on the clothes \Nof that girl who hit you.

622
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,158
You shouldn't just sit back \Nand take being treated like that.

623
00:58:00,158 --> 00:58:03,165
No need for you to feel guilty. \NI was pissed off.

624
00:58:03,165 --> 00:58:04,234
So I got some payback.

625
00:58:05,176 --> 00:58:06,184
Serves her right.

626
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:09,251
She's gonna waltz around without realizing \Nthere's a wad of gum on her clothing.

627
00:58:18,168 --> 00:58:20,218
There's something my master said...

628
00:58:20,218 --> 00:58:26,185
Devils don't fear Devil Hunters\N who are strong or brave.

629
00:58:26,185 --> 00:58:29,169
They fear Devil Hunters who have a screw loose.

630
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:32,183
Which is why I think you'll survive \Na long time in this job, Aki.

631
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:35,209
Was that an insult?

632
00:58:35,209 --> 00:58:38,163
And I'll eat your almond tofu \Nif you don't want it.

633
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:42,246
Just one.

634
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:46,175
I'm not smoking. It's bad for your bones.

635
00:58:47,244 --> 00:58:51,230
I wish you would. I get the feeling \Nwe're gonna be together for a while.

636
00:59:01,192 --> 00:59:03,172
Just one, then.

637
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:06,177
This is the first and last \Ncigarette I ever light up.

638
00:59:08,228 --> 00:59:11,182
Himeno, do you have any smokes left?

639
00:59:11,216 --> 00:59:14,182
Sorry. Last one.

640
00:59:14,182 --> 00:59:16,215
Let me have it, please.

641
00:59:18,208 --> 00:59:20,203
If you insist...

642
00:59:22,195 --> 00:59:25,171
Dude, that's kissing! No fair! \NThat's an indirect kiss!

643
00:59:25,171 --> 00:59:26,214
Shut up.

644
00:59:30,161 --> 00:59:31,230
I've got bad news.

645
00:59:32,226 --> 00:59:34,234
Remember the devil we killed?

646
00:59:34,234 --> 00:59:36,247
The one that I slew!

647
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:40,164
Well, he's a lot bigger now.

648
00:59:51,226 --> 00:59:54,169
That really is the one {\i1}I{\i0} slew.

649
00:59:54,209 --> 00:59:58,170
It traps us in a hotel... \Nand its body turns into that?

650
00:59:58,218 --> 01:00:00,198
What the hell kind of devil is this?

651
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:04,185
Humans. Hear me, humans.

652
01:00:04,185 --> 01:00:08,233
You foolish humans. \NI offer you a contract...

653
01:00:09,163 --> 01:00:10,189
It talked!

654
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:11,196
A contract?

655
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:15,191
Feed me the human known as Denji.

656
01:00:15,191 --> 01:00:17,163
Even his corpse will do.

657
01:00:17,163 --> 01:00:18,222
Let me eat him.

658
01:00:18,222 --> 01:00:23,185
Do this, and I'll let the rest \Nof you leave in peace.

659
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:26,227
You'll be free to leave! \NNow, accept this contract!

660
01:00:27,213 --> 01:00:29,243
Do it... Do it...

661
01:00:39,173 --> 01:00:41,225
Denji... let it eat you.

662
01:01:08,222 --> 01:01:10,180
Man, that's obnoxious.

663
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:13,219
Aki, can't you swallow \Nthis thing with the Fox Devil?

664
01:01:14,191 --> 01:01:15,181
Kon.

665
01:01:17,196 --> 01:01:19,223
Looks like Fox Devil isn't coming.

666
01:01:19,223 --> 01:01:22,158
We're cut off from the rest of the world.

667
01:01:22,158 --> 01:01:24,235
The Fox Devil's body is in Kyoto, \Nso that makes sense.

668
01:01:25,195 --> 01:01:28,173
Let's see what my Ghost can do, then.

669
01:01:31,172 --> 01:01:31,246
That hurt!

670
01:01:31,246 --> 01:01:36,221
It hurts! Oh, it hurts! The pain!

671
01:01:39,163 --> 01:01:41,251
It hurts...! It hurts!

672
01:01:41,251 --> 01:01:43,201
It got even bigger!

673
01:01:44,226 --> 01:01:45,251
It's pointless!

674
01:01:45,251 --> 01:01:49,177
This isn't my main body...

675
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,252
You won't find my heart here.

676
01:01:51,252 --> 01:01:54,193
You're inside of my stomach...

677
01:01:54,193 --> 01:01:58,178
and I have no weaknesses \Non this eighth floor.

678
01:01:58,211 --> 01:02:02,178
There is no way to survive this place, \Napart from accepting my offer.

679
01:02:03,211 --> 01:02:07,175
You're probably not gonna \Nlet them go, even if I do die.

680
01:02:07,175 --> 01:02:08,229
Actually, no.

681
01:02:08,229 --> 01:02:12,163
The devil used the word "contract," right?

682
01:02:12,163 --> 01:02:16,179
Those kinds of terms hold a strong sway \Nwhen a devil is involved.

683
01:02:16,179 --> 01:02:21,230
If one side makes good on the deal, \Nthe other has to or else.

684
01:02:22,164 --> 01:02:24,193
Whichever side breaks \Nthe contract ends up dying.

685
01:02:24,193 --> 01:02:27,212
So, we {\i1}would{\i0} be able to leave \Nby killing you, Denji.

686
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:31,206
Himeno... we should kill him.

687
01:02:31,257 --> 01:02:35,256
We can come up with another plan \Nonce he's dead, and we're out of here.

688
01:02:35,256 --> 01:02:38,232
We're all gonna end up starving otherwise.

689
01:02:39,168 --> 01:02:43,195
Devil Hunters are legally allowed to \Nmake contracts with devils.

690
01:02:43,195 --> 01:02:45,257
We should take the deal!

691
01:02:46,194 --> 01:02:49,174
The devil wants Denji dead.

692
01:02:49,174 --> 01:02:52,158
That means his death would benefit it,

693
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:54,187
which is why we're not accepting.

694
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:55,246
I'm with him!

695
01:02:56,199 --> 01:02:57,220
But...

696
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:59,199
I say we kill him!

697
01:03:00,196 --> 01:03:05,175
My Nobel Prize will remain forever out of \Nreach if I'm unable to leave this place!

698
01:03:05,175 --> 01:03:07,171
You must die for my Nobel.

699
01:03:07,171 --> 01:03:09,232
Fiends can't make pacts with devils.

700
01:03:09,232 --> 01:03:13,244
It wouldn't be obligated to let us leave, \Neven if you killed him.

701
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:18,194
Look, we're not killing Denji. \NWe're Devil Hunters.

702
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,169
We only kill devils.

703
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,197
Shall we wrestle to pass the time, then?

704
01:03:25,197 --> 01:03:27,220
You're just gonna try and kill me! Hell no!

705
01:03:34,203 --> 01:03:35,243
So hungry...

706
01:03:35,243 --> 01:03:40,171
Aki, have you got any kind of plan \Nfor actually getting us out of here?

707
01:03:40,171 --> 01:03:44,222
If what the devil says \Nis true, we can't kill it.

708
01:03:44,222 --> 01:03:47,159
But we're not killing Denji, either.

709
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,172
So, is the plan to starve, then?

710
01:03:53,221 --> 01:03:55,257
If we really run out of options, \NI'll use the sword.

711
01:03:55,257 --> 01:03:57,173
No, you won't.

712
01:03:58,233 --> 01:04:01,186
If that thing can get us out of here,

713
01:04:01,186 --> 01:04:02,228
shouldn't he use it?

714
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:06,236
He shouldn't use it, \Neven if we're out of options.

715
01:04:07,198 --> 01:04:09,175
If it comes to that... sorry,

716
01:04:09,256 --> 01:04:11,224
but you'll have to die, Denji!

717
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:15,225
It's gone?!

718
01:04:15,225 --> 01:04:18,225
It's gone... all the food \Nthat was left on the bed...

719
01:04:19,163 --> 01:04:20,200
None of it's left.

720
01:04:20,248 --> 01:04:21,252
Why?

721
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:30,171
You ate all of it, didn't you?

722
01:04:30,171 --> 01:04:32,226
'Twas not me. This is Denji's doing.

723
01:04:32,226 --> 01:04:34,240
Of all the obvious lies...

724
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,177
I get it now...

725
01:04:36,177 --> 01:04:39,177
I figured it out.

726
01:04:39,245 --> 01:04:43,247
We can't get out of here because \Nof that Fiend's power!

727
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:45,215
That has to be it!

728
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,215
No, it doesn't.

729
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:49,192
Calm down, Kobeni! This is the Blood Fiend—

730
01:04:49,192 --> 01:04:53,241
So you're taking her side? \NEven though we're Devil Hunters?!

731
01:04:53,241 --> 01:04:57,161
You're on the devil's side, Arai!

732
01:04:57,161 --> 01:04:58,254
You're a spy!

733
01:04:58,254 --> 01:05:00,179
He's {\i1}spy{\i0}cy.

734
01:05:00,179 --> 01:05:03,160
I... I'm not on the devil's side...

735
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:07,179
I know you're a spy!

736
01:05:10,251 --> 01:05:11,254
Was that a scream?

737
01:05:11,254 --> 01:05:13,206
We need to move!

738
01:05:22,205 --> 01:05:24,177
Kill Denji...

739
01:05:24,177 --> 01:05:27,248
Give me his heart... Give it!

740
01:05:27,248 --> 01:05:33,170
I will grow as your fear grows... \Nand with your terror, I will capture you!

741
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:36,178
So, fear me more!

742
01:05:36,178 --> 01:05:38,176
Be overcome by your impending death!

743
01:05:38,176 --> 01:05:40,205
Dread everything.

744
01:05:40,205 --> 01:05:44,167
I will be the one to kill Chainsaw...

745
01:05:44,167 --> 01:05:45,240
It will be me!

746
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:48,242
The Eternity Devil!

747
01:05:54,248 --> 01:05:56,172
The floor's tilting!

748
01:06:12,187 --> 01:06:15,221
Give me Denji's heart!

749
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:19,170
Somebody, anybody, kill Denji!

750
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:20,224
Please make him dead!

751
01:06:20,224 --> 01:06:22,178
We're running out of time!

752
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:24,193
Let's just feed him to the devil!

753
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:28,184
I'm using the sword.

754
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:31,209
You okay with that, Himeno?

755
01:06:32,172 --> 01:06:33,203
Himeno?!

756
01:06:34,222 --> 01:06:37,176
Whoa, lady! What the hell?!

757
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:41,160
We can probably get out of here \Nif he uses that sword,

758
01:06:41,186 --> 01:06:45,186
but the pact is one that takes a lot \Nof years off Aki's life in exchange.

759
01:06:45,246 --> 01:06:49,213
He's got too much to live for.

760
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:51,248
I'm sorry, Denji.

761
01:06:52,249 --> 01:06:54,224
Damn it!

762
01:06:55,164 --> 01:06:56,224
Hey, get off!

763
01:06:56,224 --> 01:06:58,174
Let me go!

764
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,200
Die!

765
01:07:30,244 --> 01:07:36,250
He might be a piece of shit that\N {\i1}deserves{\i0} being stabbed a time or two...

766
01:07:37,213 --> 01:07:40,158
But he wants the Gun Devil dead.

767
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:44,221
And I... can't kill it by myself.

768
01:07:45,193 --> 01:07:50,244
To do that, I need Devil Hunters \Nwith the guts to fight it.

769
01:07:50,244 --> 01:07:52,249
The more, the better...

770
01:07:53,254 --> 01:07:56,174
Even if it costs some of my own life...

771
01:07:57,225 --> 01:08:00,160
I'm not letting Denji die.

772
01:08:01,207 --> 01:08:04,160
Power! You're the Blood Fiend, right?

773
01:08:04,194 --> 01:08:06,210
Can you keep him from bleeding out?

774
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:10,199
I only have total control over my own blood.

775
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:12,211
The blood of others is a challenge.

776
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:18,237
But I suppose I'd need a new\N cook if topknot died.

777
01:08:18,237 --> 01:08:21,164
Given that, I have little choice.

778
01:08:27,234 --> 01:08:29,175
What do we do?

779
01:08:29,212 --> 01:08:31,175
What do we do?!

780
01:08:31,175 --> 01:08:34,238
Aki... Aki! Aki, what do we do?!

781
01:08:35,256 --> 01:08:38,163
I-It's not my fault!

782
01:08:38,163 --> 01:08:40,256
You! This is because of you!

783
01:08:40,256 --> 01:08:44,257
If you just let it eat you, \Nthis would all be over!

784
01:08:46,183 --> 01:08:47,252
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

785
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:50,185
Guess it's snack time, then.

786
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:52,247
Oh, thank goodness.

787
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,195
I'm not gonna go down smooth, though.

788
01:08:57,191 --> 01:09:00,253
So if I manage to kill this {\i1}fucking{\i0} devil...

789
01:09:01,209 --> 01:09:04,207
I still expect to get that kiss!

790
01:09:05,204 --> 01:09:07,229
Have you any plan to win?

791
01:09:08,174 --> 01:09:11,229
It's gonna hurt real bad, \Nbut I'll get my chainsaws out.

792
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:13,252
Ch-Chainsaws?

793
01:09:13,252 --> 01:09:19,167
I dunno what this devil's deal is, \Nbut it's scared of my chainsaws.

794
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:24,170
That's why it didn't try to kill me, \Nand wanted you guys to do it instead.

795
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:30,175
And I remember it was crying \Nabout pain when it got attacked...

796
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:35,182
So I figure, if I tear it up until \Nit can't take the pain no more,

797
01:09:35,252 --> 01:09:37,257
it'll wanna kill itself!

798
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:41,257
A very devilish idea indeed.

799
01:09:45,187 --> 01:09:48,158
I can't believe you did that for me.

800
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,161
Nobody asked you. Asshole.

801
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:56,163
I'm through with owing \Nanybody anything, got it?

802
01:09:56,238 --> 01:09:59,202
So once you're out of here, we're even!

803
01:10:01,209 --> 01:10:24,183


804
01:11:50,189 --> 01:11:53,186
I can't believe you did that for me.

805
01:11:53,186 --> 01:11:56,187
Nobody asked you. Asshole.

806
01:11:57,146 --> 01:12:01,195
I'm through with owing \Nanybody anything, got it?

807
01:12:02,183 --> 01:12:05,183
So once you're out of here, we're even!

808
01:12:15,151 --> 01:12:16,181
It's over...

809
01:12:34,161 --> 01:12:38,157
I knew you were alive, Chainsaw!

810
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:46,217
Yeow!

811
01:12:48,151 --> 01:12:50,148
All better!

812
01:12:51,190 --> 01:12:53,171
This is pointless, Chainsaw!

813
01:12:53,171 --> 01:12:54,206
The pain!

814
01:12:54,206 --> 01:12:56,168
It hurts!

815
01:12:56,168 --> 01:12:59,146
You won't find my heart in here!

816
01:12:59,146 --> 01:13:00,173
You can't kill me!

817
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:12,215
A devil?!

818
01:13:13,159 --> 01:13:14,215
This bodes ill.

819
01:13:15,159 --> 01:13:17,220
Denji's losing blood ceaselessly.

820
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:21,154
When he's lost too much, \Nhis chainsaws will retract.

821
01:13:27,142 --> 01:13:30,154
You are so much weaker now.

822
01:13:30,154 --> 01:13:33,148
How far you have fallen, Chainsaw?!

823
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:18,201
My chainsaws are in?

824
01:15:18,201 --> 01:15:20,182
Need more blood!

825
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,149
You've failed!

826
01:15:22,149 --> 01:15:23,142
Die!

827
01:15:23,142 --> 01:15:24,194
Chainsaw!

828
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:36,209
This blood might seriously taste like shit...

829
01:15:37,136 --> 01:15:40,209
But watching you shriek in pain...

830
01:15:40,209 --> 01:15:44,176
Makes it sweet like strawberry jam!

831
01:15:46,217 --> 01:15:49,202
The hunters that devils fear...

832
01:15:53,185 --> 01:15:56,177
are the ones with a couple of screws loose.

833
01:16:00,149 --> 01:16:02,203
Sahara had his head on straight...

834
01:16:03,195 --> 01:16:05,178
So he died.

835
01:16:05,217 --> 01:16:11,141
Same goes for Kinouchi, \Nand Subaru, and Sasaki. All sane.

836
01:16:11,141 --> 01:16:14,224
They were reasonable enough \Nto fear attacks from a devil,

837
01:16:14,224 --> 01:16:17,209
and that fear made the devils stronger.

838
01:16:19,153 --> 01:16:22,218
You been working with Aki for a while now.\N What do you think about him?

839
01:16:23,218 --> 01:16:25,147
Is his head on straight?

840
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:29,218
I wouldn't say that about anyone \Nwho's trying to kill the Gun Devil.

841
01:16:30,173 --> 01:16:34,194
Didn't you join Public Safety because\N you were after the Gun Devil, too?

842
01:16:35,148 --> 01:16:37,231
You got any screws loose?

843
01:16:38,215 --> 01:16:40,157
No, sir.

844
01:16:40,203 --> 01:16:41,227
Exactly.

845
01:16:41,227 --> 01:16:47,208
Most hunters, including you, \Nare out to put the Gun Devil down.

846
01:16:47,208 --> 01:16:50,214
They're earnest. Honest. Straightforward.

847
01:16:50,214 --> 01:16:54,188
And that means the devils know \Nexactly how to fuck with them.

848
01:16:55,171 --> 01:17:00,159
But there's no telling what \Na crazy person's thinking.

849
01:17:00,195 --> 01:17:03,223
And even devils are afraid \Nof what they don't understand.

850
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:08,224
You're drinking too much again, master.

851
01:17:08,224 --> 01:17:11,138
See, that's being sensible again.

852
01:17:11,138 --> 01:17:14,135
Can't be unhinged without \Nloosening the screws a bit every day.

853
01:17:19,203 --> 01:17:22,205
And if you're still visiting your \Npartners' graves every month,

854
01:17:22,205 --> 01:17:24,162
then yours are still pretty tight.

855
01:17:25,176 --> 01:17:26,228
I'm heading home.

856
01:17:26,228 --> 01:17:30,149
Aki's still a punk, so make \Nsure to work him over.

857
01:17:30,218 --> 01:17:32,187
I'll take it one step at a time.

858
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:34,212
Not good enough.

859
01:17:35,173 --> 01:17:39,137
The kid's serious about \Ncollecting the meat chunks, right?

860
01:17:39,137 --> 01:17:42,147
He's gonna actually find \Nthe Gun Devil if he does.

861
01:17:57,196 --> 01:17:58,190
No...

862
01:17:58,190 --> 01:18:01,223
No, no, no, no, no, no—

863
01:18:03,207 --> 01:18:04,224
No.

864
01:18:05,184 --> 01:18:09,209
Aki, you wanna join \Nthe private sector with me?

865
01:18:10,207 --> 01:18:13,197
I received a pretty generous offer!

866
01:18:13,197 --> 01:18:16,147
Instead of chasing the Gun,

867
01:18:16,147 --> 01:18:21,140
we could go out for lunch, \Nsee a movie on the way home,

868
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:22,227
and really enjoy ourselves.

869
01:18:24,162 --> 01:18:26,213
If you wanna go out \Nfor drinks, I'll join you.

870
01:18:26,213 --> 01:18:29,214
But I have no intention \Nof ever going private.

871
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:31,231
And I'll take your almond tofu.

872
01:18:33,178 --> 01:18:35,214
Then hand me a cigarette in exchange.

873
01:18:43,193 --> 01:18:47,215
If Aki fights the Gun Devil, he's gonna die.

874
01:18:48,204 --> 01:18:51,202
Not because we're too weak,

875
01:18:51,202 --> 01:18:55,148
or because it's the kind of devil that \Ncan kill hundreds of people in seconds.

876
01:18:56,163 --> 01:19:01,149
It's because Aki's cool, \Nand serious, and kind...

877
01:19:02,135 --> 01:19:04,152
and normal, like most people.

878
01:19:05,213 --> 01:19:06,194
But...

879
01:19:08,188 --> 01:19:09,209
Take that!

880
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:13,216
Ow, ow!

881
01:19:18,155 --> 01:19:19,187
It...

882
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:20,202
It's over.

883
01:19:26,166 --> 01:19:27,194
But him?

884
01:19:28,166 --> 01:19:30,170
Eureka, dude.

885
01:19:31,219 --> 01:19:35,147
I cut you up, and you bleed.

886
01:19:35,147 --> 01:19:38,166
I drink that blood and heal!

887
01:19:38,208 --> 01:19:42,225
I'm a fucking perpetual motion machine!

888
01:19:43,219 --> 01:19:47,193
That Nobel Prize is mine!

889
01:19:50,212 --> 01:19:53,209
I've never seen anyone crazier than him,

890
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:57,135
so maybe he can kill the Gun Devil!

891
01:20:09,233 --> 01:20:11,205
Pain...

892
01:20:13,210 --> 01:20:15,178
Ow, ow...

893
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:20,212
It hurts...

894
01:20:23,231 --> 01:20:26,192
You still alive, Aki?

895
01:20:29,187 --> 01:20:30,220
How long...

896
01:20:31,196 --> 01:20:33,188
How long has it been?

897
01:20:34,155 --> 01:20:37,201
About three days since \Nyou got stabbed, I think?

898
01:20:38,168 --> 01:20:39,227
Meowy...

899
01:20:40,172 --> 01:20:43,178
Let's all go out for drinks.

900
01:20:44,151 --> 01:20:47,202
Since it's over... I'm gonna sleep a bit.

901
01:20:48,219 --> 01:20:50,163
It's over?

902
01:20:52,165 --> 01:20:54,228
This is my weakness...

903
01:20:54,228 --> 01:20:56,166
It's my heart.

904
01:20:56,166 --> 01:20:57,147
Please kill me.

905
01:20:57,147 --> 01:20:58,153
I'm sorry.

906
01:20:58,153 --> 01:20:59,150
I apologize.

907
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:00,141
It {\i1}hurts{\i0}...

908
01:21:00,141 --> 01:21:02,194
What, already?!

909
01:21:02,194 --> 01:21:07,142
I was still having fun! \NIt was like being in a pool!

910
01:21:10,167 --> 01:21:11,146
{\pos(251,85)\fscx85\fad(1,740)}AUTOMATED

911
01:21:18,152 --> 01:21:19,197
We're out.

912
01:21:22,219 --> 01:21:26,211
Got a piece of the Gun Devil's flesh,\N the sky is clear...

913
01:21:26,211 --> 01:21:29,161
And I'm feeling good, \Nlike I just took a huge shit.

914
01:21:29,161 --> 01:21:31,180
It's like I'm floating...

915
01:21:33,190 --> 01:21:34,180
Whoa there.

916
01:21:36,179 --> 01:21:37,199
He's out...

917
01:21:38,171 --> 01:21:41,174
Makes sense, considering he was fighting \Nthe devil the whole time without sleeping.

918
01:21:43,163 --> 01:21:46,200
We'll get Aki and Denji to a hospital.

919
01:21:47,139 --> 01:21:50,148
You two head back \Nto the office and check in.

920
01:21:57,217 --> 01:21:59,212
A welcoming party?

921
01:21:59,212 --> 01:22:00,206
Yep.

922
01:22:00,206 --> 01:22:03,188
Since the full Division 4 \Nis finally assembled,

923
01:22:03,188 --> 01:22:05,165
we ought to get to know each other better,

924
01:22:05,165 --> 01:22:08,179
and deal with some of our outstanding issues.

925
01:22:08,179 --> 01:22:09,192
What issues?

926
01:22:09,192 --> 01:22:14,215
Well, the thing is, Kobeni and Arai \Nare talking about quitting Public Safety.

927
01:22:14,215 --> 01:22:17,182
Not only are they afraid of the devils,

928
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:20,166
they feel pretty guilty \Nabout trying to kill Denji, too.

929
01:22:21,146 --> 01:22:23,204
You tried to kill him, too.

930
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:24,223
I know, right?!

931
01:22:24,223 --> 01:22:28,157
Kids these days! They're so sensitive.

932
01:22:28,157 --> 01:22:31,154
Would it kill them to be a little bolder?

933
01:22:31,229 --> 01:22:35,172
Over drinks, they'll be able to \Napologize to Denji easily,

934
01:22:35,172 --> 01:22:37,206
and we'll be able to \Nconvince them to not quit.

935
01:22:37,206 --> 01:22:39,159
You're just in this for drinks.

936
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:43,210
It wasn't much, but I found \Na chunk of its flesh.

937
01:22:44,197 --> 01:22:47,159
If we're doing this, \Nit needs to be this week.

938
01:22:47,159 --> 01:22:48,219
Why's that?

939
01:22:49,155 --> 01:22:52,141
If we're having a drinking party, \NI want to invite Ms. Makima.

940
01:22:59,174 --> 01:23:02,139
She's going on a business trip \Nto Kyoto next week.

941
01:23:02,139 --> 01:23:06,158
With so many devils targeting Denji, \Nshe's looking into getting reinforcements.

942
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:08,172
So the party needs to be this week.

943
01:23:11,168 --> 01:23:12,208
Be honest with me.

944
01:23:13,151 --> 01:23:15,171
What do you think Denji {\i1}is{\i0}?

945
01:23:17,146 --> 01:23:20,211
That devil seemed to know about him,

946
01:23:20,211 --> 01:23:22,222
and I've never seen anything \Nlike what he turned into.

947
01:23:22,222 --> 01:23:27,197
But the biggest mystery is how much \NMs. Makima seems to be interested in him.

948
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:33,207
She used to travel all the time, \Nbut she's stuck to Tokyo lately,

949
01:23:33,207 --> 01:23:35,190
and that's probably because of Denji.

950
01:23:36,164 --> 01:23:39,161
Does she know his secret?

951
01:23:43,166 --> 01:23:45,162
Wanna get her hammered and ask about it?

952
01:23:47,215 --> 01:23:49,162
Cheers!

953
01:23:49,162 --> 01:23:52,138
Man, all this stuff smells awesome!

954
01:23:52,138 --> 01:23:55,200
This is enough food for a lifetime!

955
01:23:53,143 --> 01:23:54,191
That's the stuff!

956
01:24:00,175 --> 01:24:02,155
Oh, here we go.

957
01:24:01,186 --> 01:24:03,211
This is nuts!

958
01:24:02,155 --> 01:24:03,211
Here's your plate.

959
01:24:03,211 --> 01:24:05,224
Where do I even start? \NIt all smells great.

960
01:24:05,224 --> 01:24:09,140
This is good. It's been six months \Nsince I last had anything to drink.

961
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:11,194
I only drink a bit at home, too.

962
01:24:11,194 --> 01:24:13,151
Away with you!

963
01:24:13,151 --> 01:24:14,231
The sashimi shall all be mine!

964
01:24:14,231 --> 01:24:17,182
What even is this? Looks tasty!

965
01:24:18,185 --> 01:24:22,157
Sorry... I got a little lost.

966
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:25,145
Kobe, Kobe! Right over here!

967
01:24:25,145 --> 01:24:27,158
Ms. Makima says she'll be late.

968
01:24:29,167 --> 01:24:30,197
Three parfaits.

969
01:24:30,197 --> 01:24:31,199
And then...

970
01:24:32,154 --> 01:24:34,171
Three shiratama dumpling trays.

971
01:24:35,148 --> 01:24:38,151
I've never had anything this good before.

972
01:24:38,151 --> 01:24:41,167
You send most of your pay home, right?

973
01:24:41,167 --> 01:24:42,174
Be sure to eat your fill.

974
01:24:42,174 --> 01:24:43,218
Hands off, you scoundrel!

975
01:24:43,218 --> 01:24:46,147
The fried chicken is all mine!

976
01:24:46,209 --> 01:24:49,219
You didn't bring your Fiend, Fushi?

977
01:24:49,219 --> 01:24:52,199
They're a little too scary \Nfor a place like this.

978
01:24:52,199 --> 01:24:56,186
I envy how reasonable yours is, Hayakawa.

979
01:24:56,215 --> 01:24:57,186
Hey!

980
01:24:57,186 --> 01:25:00,168
You're young, so order \Nwhatever you want! And eat up!

981
01:25:00,168 --> 01:25:03,189
Damn it! I can't read most of these kanji...

982
01:25:01,161 --> 01:25:05,161
{\an7\fscx100\fscy100\p1\bord0\shad0\c&H8CA9C7&\blur6\t(1,2000,\blur0)\pos(-7,2)}m 225 15 l 225 48 422 48 422 15

983
01:25:08,144 --> 01:25:10,180
So... about that kiss...

984
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:15,211
I'm too bashful to do it right now.

985
01:25:15,211 --> 01:25:17,188
Let me drink a bit more first.

986
01:25:20,138 --> 01:25:22,204
I'll make it a juicy one, too.

987
01:25:22,204 --> 01:25:26,176
So will you forgive us \Nfor trying to kill you?

988
01:25:26,176 --> 01:25:29,173
Dude, all is forgiven! Super forgiven!

989
01:25:30,152 --> 01:25:33,224
This is a welcoming party for the rookies, \Nso stand up and introduce yourselves!

990
01:25:34,167 --> 01:25:37,148
Your name, age, and the devil \Nyou're contracted with!

991
01:25:37,187 --> 01:25:40,196
Don't reveal your devil contract in public.

992
01:25:40,196 --> 01:25:44,158
You shouldn't share that \Nwith anyone you don't trust.

993
01:25:44,158 --> 01:25:46,215
Man, you never loosen up, do you?

994
01:25:46,215 --> 01:25:50,141
Aw, it's fine! It's probably fine.

995
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:52,181
I wanna know hobbies, too.

996
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:54,179
They tell you a lot about a person.

997
01:25:54,216 --> 01:25:58,161
I'm Denji. I'm 16, if I remember right.

998
01:25:58,161 --> 01:26:01,179
My hobbies are eating and sleeping!

999
01:26:02,175 --> 01:26:03,192
Yikes, that is {\i1}young{\i0}.

1000
01:26:04,175 --> 01:26:06,202
You didn't drink, did you?!

1001
01:26:06,202 --> 01:26:07,180
Just tea.

1002
01:26:08,136 --> 01:26:11,134
I'm Hirokazu Arai! I'm 22 years old!

1003
01:26:11,134 --> 01:26:12,230
I've got a contract with the Fox Devil!

1004
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:14,193
My hobby is writing haiku!

1005
01:26:15,151 --> 01:26:17,206
That's the same devil as Hayakaptain.

1006
01:26:17,206 --> 01:26:20,230
The Fox Devil is friendly toward humans.

1007
01:26:20,230 --> 01:26:23,170
So many hunters make contracts\N with the Fox Devil.

1008
01:26:23,170 --> 01:26:26,187
But only hotties get to call \Non the Fox Devil's head!

1009
01:26:26,187 --> 01:26:28,207
As devils go, the Fox is down bad.

1010
01:26:30,164 --> 01:26:32,155
I'm Kobeni Higashiyama.

1011
01:26:32,155 --> 01:26:33,182
I'm 20...

1012
01:26:33,182 --> 01:26:36,205
I've got a devil contract... \Nbut it's a secret.

1013
01:26:36,205 --> 01:26:39,201
My hobby is eating tasty things.

1014
01:26:40,163 --> 01:26:41,206
Isn't her outfit cute?

1015
01:26:41,206 --> 01:26:42,171
Yeah.

1016
01:26:42,206 --> 01:26:44,221
It's a hand-me-down from my sister.

1017
01:26:44,221 --> 01:26:48,197
Kobeni has eight sisters. Isn't that crazy?

1018
01:26:45,156 --> 01:26:48,197
Hey, where's your rookie, Fushi?

1019
01:26:48,224 --> 01:26:51,197
I'm sad to report that they \Nwere killed yesterday.

1020
01:26:53,188 --> 01:26:55,170
Rest in peace!

1021
01:26:55,170 --> 01:26:59,135
They will be... mist... pissed... missed?

1022
01:26:59,135 --> 01:27:00,223
Already wasted, huh?

1023
01:27:02,199 --> 01:27:05,157
Do people really die that often?

1024
01:27:05,157 --> 01:27:08,186
Public Safety handles the devils \Ntoo tough for the private sector.

1025
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,151
Yeah, we're always dropping like flies.

1026
01:27:11,151 --> 01:27:13,224
No one who joined up at the \Nsame time as me is still alive.

1027
01:27:13,224 --> 01:27:18,150
Denji's not gonna die, \Ncuz he wants a smooch!

1028
01:27:20,176 --> 01:27:22,224
Himeno gets really {\i1}friendly{\i0} \Nwhen she's drunk.

1029
01:27:23,227 --> 01:27:27,213
I'm pretty sure she's kissed everyone here,\N apart from the rookies.

1030
01:27:27,213 --> 01:27:29,201
There's no escaping her.

1031
01:27:32,188 --> 01:27:33,214
That's a guaranteed kiss!

1032
01:27:36,214 --> 01:27:40,160
Today's the day... of my first kiss.

1033
01:27:40,195 --> 01:27:41,189
What kiss?

1034
01:27:42,186 --> 01:27:44,180
Ms. Makima!

1035
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:47,173
Excuse me, I'd like a draft beer.

1036
01:27:47,222 --> 01:27:50,154
Have a seat, Ms. Makima.

1037
01:27:52,207 --> 01:27:55,162
I've never seen her in person before.

1038
01:27:57,163 --> 01:27:59,200
So, are you kissing someone, Denji?

1039
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:00,224
No, ma'am!

1040
01:28:00,224 --> 01:28:04,138
Aw, are we not gonna kiss, Denji?!

1041
01:28:04,138 --> 01:28:05,191
We are!

1042
01:28:08,198 --> 01:28:11,138
Excuse me. Another beer.

1043
01:28:13,173 --> 01:28:15,135
So, what's this about kisses?

1044
01:28:15,135 --> 01:28:18,227
I don't want Ms. Makima \Nto see me kiss Himeno.

1045
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:21,143
No smoochies?

1046
01:28:21,143 --> 01:28:25,140
But I want a kiss with tongue \Njust as bad!

1047
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:28,140
I've gotta try and change the subject!

1048
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:32,233
Ms. Makima! Y'know, I got one \Nof them Gun Devil thingies!

1049
01:28:32,233 --> 01:28:36,166
Yes, I heard. That's very impressive, Denji.

1050
01:28:36,206 --> 01:28:41,207
We've never seen devils appearing with \NGun Devil flesh this frequently before.

1051
01:28:41,207 --> 01:28:44,176
Given how the most recent one \Nwas targeting Denji,

1052
01:28:44,176 --> 01:28:47,142
something must be going on.

1053
01:28:47,178 --> 01:28:51,152
Do you know what Denji's deal is, ma'am?

1054
01:28:53,148 --> 01:28:54,168
Relinquish that!

1055
01:28:56,186 --> 01:28:57,193
That, too, is mine!

1056
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,144
I'll tell you if you can outdrink me.

1057
01:29:06,185 --> 01:29:08,169
Two more beers, please.

1058
01:29:09,218 --> 01:29:13,157
I want in on that! Make it three!

1059
01:29:13,157 --> 01:29:15,170
Horse sashimi! Fried chicken! \NAnd more horse sashimi!

1060
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:16,216
Fried chicken!

1061
01:29:22,199 --> 01:29:23,212
That's mine, too.

1062
01:29:23,212 --> 01:29:26,167
Another beer, if you would.

1063
01:29:26,222 --> 01:29:28,222
You're pretty impressive, Power.

1064
01:29:28,222 --> 01:29:32,200
There aren't a lot of Fiends \Nwho can control their urge to kill.

1065
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,168
A feat of my advanced IQ!

1066
01:29:35,168 --> 01:29:40,170
Is IQ part of it? How high is yours, then?

1067
01:29:40,222 --> 01:29:41,206
Um... 100?

1068
01:29:41,206 --> 01:29:43,197
Is that high?

1069
01:29:43,197 --> 01:29:46,184
I think my score was around 100, too.

1070
01:29:46,184 --> 01:29:47,231
Then it was 120.

1071
01:29:48,169 --> 01:29:50,229
If I remember right, Fushi's is high.

1072
01:29:50,229 --> 01:29:52,205
Specifically, 134.

1073
01:29:52,205 --> 01:29:55,198
Wow, must be proud enough\Nto actually remember it.

1074
01:29:56,145 --> 01:29:58,222
If I recall, mine was 500?

1075
01:29:58,222 --> 01:29:59,220
Perhaps 1000?

1076
01:30:04,195 --> 01:30:05,221
Oh my.

1077
01:30:10,184 --> 01:30:11,209
She's watching!

1078
01:30:11,209 --> 01:30:13,146
Ms. Makima's watching.

1079
01:30:13,193 --> 01:30:14,204
But what is this?

1080
01:30:14,135 --> 01:30:15,176
The kiss is afoot!

1081
01:30:14,204 --> 01:30:16,184
Is that a tongue I feel?

1082
01:30:16,184 --> 01:30:19,143
Feels good... soft! Really soft!

1083
01:30:19,143 --> 01:30:21,135
What the hell?! It's her tongue...

1084
01:30:21,135 --> 01:30:23,141
But it's melting in my mouth?!

1085
01:30:23,141 --> 01:30:24,222
That's... not... a tongue!

1086
01:30:25,182 --> 01:30:26,223
It's puke!

1087
01:30:29,185 --> 01:30:31,198
Well, that's traumatic.

1088
01:30:31,198 --> 01:30:33,140
Uh-oh...

1089
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:35,199
Excuse me, can we get \Nsomething to wipe this up?

1090
01:30:35,231 --> 01:30:38,194
Oh, this isn't good! Not good at all!

1091
01:30:40,136 --> 01:30:44,187
Denji will swallow anything \Nremotely nutritious!

1092
01:30:49,224 --> 01:30:50,233
Pochita!

1093
01:30:51,185 --> 01:30:53,159
I found something edible!

1094
01:31:03,153 --> 01:31:04,172
Check it out, Pochita!

1095
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:07,186
Those rats are chowing on some drunk's puke!

1096
01:31:07,186 --> 01:31:10,148
Eating puke! What a joke!

1097
01:31:10,148 --> 01:31:12,211
What kinda mammals are they?!

1098
01:31:16,189 --> 01:31:21,136
Unbelievable... Himeno has \Nabsolutely no restraint.

1099
01:31:25,212 --> 01:31:28,143
My method for throwing up \Nworks pretty well, right?

1100
01:31:28,143 --> 01:31:31,188
I used to look after my mom when \Nshe came home drunk from work.

1101
01:31:32,138 --> 01:31:35,208
Not that it makes me as good \Na Devil Hunter as you.

1102
01:31:36,183 --> 01:31:37,213
I'm pretty jealous.

1103
01:31:39,176 --> 01:31:41,163
Jealous?!

1104
01:31:41,163 --> 01:31:45,212
Dude... My first kiss tasted like barf!

1105
01:31:45,212 --> 01:31:47,202
And you're jealous?!

1106
01:31:57,158 --> 01:32:00,141
I'll see Hayakawa and his household home.

1107
01:31:58,227 --> 01:32:00,141
You wanna drop by somewhere else?

1108
01:32:00,141 --> 01:32:01,220
I drank a lot...

1109
01:32:02,166 --> 01:32:06,178
Ms. Makima paid the tab tonight, \Neveryone, so show your gratitude.

1110
01:32:06,207 --> 01:32:10,143
Nothing tastes better than \Ndrinks someone else paid for.

1111
01:32:10,143 --> 01:32:10,216
Yep.

1112
01:32:13,195 --> 01:32:15,204
Huh? Where's Denji?

1113
01:32:15,204 --> 01:32:20,142
I saw Himeno pick him up \Nand walk off somewhere.

1114
01:32:24,168 --> 01:32:26,218
It's dark... So dark...

1115
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:29,189
Where the hell am I?

1116
01:32:29,189 --> 01:32:33,193
Water... Water... Water...

1117
01:32:34,213 --> 01:32:38,228
Come to think of it, the puke \Ngirl gave me a barf kiss.

1118
01:32:39,205 --> 01:32:43,231
Damn it! Water, water...

1119
01:33:01,228 --> 01:33:05,180
Huh... It's Den-Den-Denji?

1120
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:08,144
What are you doing in my place?

1121
01:33:10,134 --> 01:33:12,201
Did I bring you here?

1122
01:33:12,201 --> 01:33:14,135
Huh?

1123
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:18,233
I'm so dizzy... What the hell?

1124
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:27,141
Y'know, I noticed you're \Nhead over heels for Makima.

1125
01:33:28,191 --> 01:33:30,191
My head's spinning...

1126
01:33:30,233 --> 01:33:35,180
You could do better than \Nthat bitch, seriously.

1127
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:41,159
You and Aki, fawning all over her! Ugh...

1128
01:33:41,159 --> 01:33:42,191
Seriously!

1129
01:33:42,191 --> 01:33:43,198
Moo-ve on!

1130
01:34:08,158 --> 01:34:09,163
Wanna do it?

1131
01:34:09,216 --> 01:34:10,161
